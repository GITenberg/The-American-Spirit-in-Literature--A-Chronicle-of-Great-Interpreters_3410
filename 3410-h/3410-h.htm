      The Pioneers
    </p>
    <p class="noindent">
      <span class="smcap">The</span> United States of America has been from the
      beginning in a perpetual change. The physical and mental restlessness of
      the American and the temporary nature of many of his arrangements are
      largely due to the experimental character of the exploration and
      development of this continent. The new energies released by the settlement
      of the colonies were indeed guided by stern determination, wise
      forethought, and inventive skill; but no one has ever really known the
      outcome of the experiment. It is a story of faith, of
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Effort, and expectation, and desire,<br /> And something evermore about to
      be.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span> An
      Alexander Hamilton may urge with passionate force the adoption of the
      Constitution, without any firm conviction as to its permanence. The most
      clear-sighted American of the Civil War period recognized this element of
      uncertainty in our American adventure when he declared: "We are now
      testing whether this nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated,
      can long endure." More than fifty years have passed since that war
      reaffirmed the binding force of the Constitution and apparently sealed the
      perpetuity of the Union. Yet the gigantic economic and social changes now
      in progress are serving to show that the United States has its full share
      of the anxieties which beset all human institutions in this daily altering
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are but strangers in an inn, but passengers in a ship," said Roger
      Williams. This sense of the transiency of human effort, the perishable
      nature of human institutions, was quick in the consciousness of the
      gentleman adventurers and sober Puritan citizens who emigrated from
      England to the New World. It had been a familiar note in the poetry of
      that Elizabethan period which had followed with such breathless interest
      the exploration of America. It was a conception which could be shared
      alike by a saint like John Cotton or a <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span> soldier of fortune like John Smith.
      Men are tent-dwellers. Today they settle here, and tomorrow they have
      struck camp and are gone. We are strangers and sojourners, as all our
      fathers were.
    </p>
    <p>
      This instinct of the camper has stamped itself upon American life and
      thought. Venturesomeness, physical and moral daring, resourcefulness in
      emergencies, indifference to negligible details, wastefulness of
      materials, boundless hope and confidence in the morrow, are
      characteristics of the American. It is scarcely an exaggeration to say
      that the "good American" has been he who has most resembled a good camper.
      He has had robust health&mdash;unless or until he has abused it,&mdash;a
      tolerant disposition, and an ability to apply his fingers or his brain to
      many unrelated and unexpected tasks. He is disposed to blaze his own
      trail. He has a touch of prodigality, and, withal, a knack of keeping his
      tent or his affairs in better order than they seem. Above all, he has been
      ever ready to break camp when he feels the impulse to wander. He likes to
      be "foot-loose." If he does not build his roads as solidly as the Roman
      roads were built, nor his houses like the English houses, it is because he
      feels that he is here today and gone tomorrow. If he has squandered the
      physical <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
      resources of his neighborhood, cutting the forests recklessly, exhausting
      the soil, surrendering water power and minerals into a few far-clutching
      fingers, he has done it because he expects, like Voltaire's Signor
      Pococurante, "to have a new garden tomorrow, built on a nobler plan." When
      New York State grew too crowded for Cooper's Leather-Stocking, he
      shouldered his pack, whistled to his dog, glanced at the sun, and struck a
      bee-line for the Mississippi. Nothing could be more typical of the first
      three hundred years of American history.
    </p>
    <p>
      The traits of the pioneer have thus been the characteristic traits of the
      American in action. The memories of successive generations have tended to
      stress these qualities to the neglect of others. Everyone who has enjoyed
      the free life of the woods will confess that his own judgment upon his
      casual summer associates turns, quite naturally and almost exclusively,
      upon their characteristics as woodsmen. Out of the woods, these gentlemen
      may be more or less admirable divines, pedants, men of affairs; but the
      verdict of their companions in the forest is based chiefly upon the single
      question of their adaptability to the environment of the camp. Are they
      quick of eye and foot, skillful with rod and gun, cheerful on rainy days,
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span> ready to
      do a little more than their share of drudgery? If so, memory holds them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some such unconscious selection as this has been at work in the
      classification of our representative men. The building of the nation and
      the literary expression of its purpose and ideals are tasks which have
      called forth the strength of a great variety of individuals. Some of these
      men have proved to be peculiarly fitted for a specific service,
      irrespective of the question of their general intellectual powers, or
      their rank as judged by the standard of European performance in the same
      field. Thus the battle of New Orleans, in European eyes a mere bit of
      frontier fighting, made Andrew Jackson a "hero" as indubitably as if he
      had defeated Napoleon at Waterloo. It gave him the Presidency.
    </p>
    <p>
      The analogy holds in literature. Certain expressions of American sentiment
      or conviction have served to summarize or to clarify the spirit of the
      nation. The authors of these productions have frequently won the
      recognition and affection of their contemporaries by means of prose and
      verse quite unsuited to sustain the test of severe critical standards.
      Neither Longfellow's <i>Excelsior</i> nor Poe's <i>Bells</i> nor
      Whittier's <i>Maud Muller</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6"
      id="Page_6">6</a></span> is among the best poems of the three writers in
      question, yet there was something in each of these productions which
      caught the fancy of a whole American generation. It expressed one phase of
      the national mind in a given historical period.
    </p>
    <p>
      The historian of literature is bound to take account of this question of
      literary vogue, as it is highly significant of the temper of successive
      generations in any country. But it is of peculiar interest to the student
      of the literature produced in the United States. Is this literature
      "American," or is it "English literature in America," as Professor Wendell
      and other scholars have preferred to call it? I should be one of the last
      to minimize the enormous influence of England upon the mind and the
      writing of all the English-speaking countries of the globe. Yet it will be
      one of the purposes of the present book to indicate the existence here,
      even in colonial times, of a point of view differing from that of the
      mother country, and destined to differ increasingly with the lapse of
      time. Since the formation of our Federal Union, in particular, the books
      produced in the United States have tended to exhibit certain
      characteristics which differentiate them from the books produced in other
      English-speaking countries. We <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7"
      id="Page_7">7</a></span> must beware, of course, of what the late Charles
      Francis Adams once called the "filiopietistic" fallacy. The "American"
      qualities of our literature must be judged in connection with its
      conformity to universal standards of excellence. Tested by any universal
      standard, <i>The Scarlet Letter</i> is a notable romance. It has won a
      secure place among the literature written by men of English blood and
      speech. Yet to overlook the peculiarly local or provincial characteristics
      of this remarkable story is to miss the secret of its inspiration. It
      could have been written only by a New Englander, in the atmosphere of a
      certain epoch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our task, then, in this rapid review of the chief interpreters of the
      American spirit in literature, is a twofold one. We are primarily
      concerned with a procession of men, each of whom is interesting as an
      individual and as a writer. But we cannot watch the individuals long
      without perceiving the general direction of their march, the ideas that
      animate them, the common hopes and loyalties that make up the life of
      their spirit. To become aware of these general tendencies is to understand
      the "American" note in our national writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our historians have taught us that the history of the United States is an
      evolution towards political <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8"
      id="Page_8">8</a></span> unity. The separatist, particularist movements
      are gradually thrust to one side. In literary history, likewise, we best
      remember those authors who fall into line with what we now perceive to
      have been the course of our literary development. The erratic men and
      women, the "sports" of the great experiment, are ultimately neglected by
      the critics, unless, like the leaders of political insurrections, those
      writing men and women have raised a notable standard of revolt. No doubt
      the apparently unique literary specimens, if clearly understood in their
      origins and surroundings, would be found rooted in the general laws of
      literary evolution. But these laws are not easy to codify and we must
      avoid the temptation to discover, in any particular period, more of unity
      than there actually was. And we must always remember that there will be
      beautiful prose and verse unrelated to the main national tendencies save
      as "the literature of escape." We owe this lesson to the genius of Edgar
      Allan Poe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us test these principles by applying them to the earliest colonists.
      The first book written on the soil of what is now the United States was
      Captain John Smith's <i>True Relation</i> of the planting of the Virginia
      colony in 1607. It was published in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9"
      id="Page_9">9</a></span> London in 1608. The Captain was a typical
      Elizabethan adventurer, with a gift, like so many of his class, for
      picturesque narrative. In what sense, if at all, may his writings on
      American topics be classified as "American" literary productions? It is
      clear that his experiences in the New World were only one phase of the
      variegated life of this English soldier of fortune. But the American
      imagination has persistently claimed him as representing something
      peculiarly ours, namely, a kind of pioneer hardihood, resourcefulness,
      leadership, which was essential to the exploration and conquest of the
      wilderness. Most of Smith's companions were unfitted for the ordeal which
      he survived. They perished miserably in the "starving time." But he was of
      the stuff from which triumphant immigrants have ever been made, and it is
      our recognition of the presence of these qualities in the Captain which
      makes us think of his books dealing with America as if they were "American
      books." There are other narratives by colonists temporarily residing in
      the Virginia plantations which gratify our historical curiosity, but which
      we no more consider a part of American literature than the books written
      by Stevenson, Kipling, and Wells during their casual visits to this
      country. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
      But Captain Smith's <i>True Relation</i> impresses us, like Mark Twain's
      <i>Roughing It</i>, with being somehow true to type. In each of these
      books the possible unveracities in detail are a confirmation of their
      representative American character.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other words, we have unconsciously formulated, in the course of
      centuries, a general concept of "the pioneer." Novelists, poets, and
      historians have elaborated this conception. Nothing is more inevitable
      than our reaching back to the beginning of the seventeenth century and
      endeavoring to select, among the thousands of Englishmen who emigrated or
      even thought of emigrating to this country, those who possessed the
      genuine heart and sinew of the permanent settler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver Cromwell, for instance, is said to have thought of emigrating
      hither in 1637. If he had joined his friends John Cotton and Roger
      Williams in New England, who can doubt that the personal characteristics
      of "my brave Oliver" would today be identified with the "American"
      qualities which we discover in 1637 on the shores of Massachusetts Bay?
      And what an American settler Cromwell would have made!
    </p>
    <p>
      If we turn from physical and moral daring to the <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span> field of theological and
      political speculation, it is easy today to select, among the writings of
      the earliest colonists, certain radical utterances which seem to presage
      the very temper of the late eighteenth century. Pastor John Robinson's
      farewell address to the Pilgrims at Leyden in 1620 contained the famous
      words: "The Lord has more truth yet to break forth out of His holy Word. I
      cannot sufficiently bewail the condition of the reformed churches, who are
      come to a period in religion.&hellip; Luther and Calvin were great and
      shining lights in their times, yet they penetrated not into the whole
      counsel of God." Now John Robinson, like Oliver Cromwell, never set foot
      on American soil, but he is identified, none the less, with the spirit of
      American liberalism in religion.

      In political discussion, the early emergence of that type of independence
      familiar to the decade 1765-75 is equally striking. In a letter written in
      1818, John Adams insisted that "the principles and feelings which produced
      the Revolution ought to be traced back for two hundred years, and sought
      in the history of the country from the first plantations in America." "I
      have always laughed," he declared in an earlier letter, "at the
      affectation of representing American independence <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span> as a novel idea, as a modern
      discovery, as a late invention. The idea of it as a possible thing, as a
      probable event, nay as a necessary and unavoidable measure, in case Great
      Britain should assume an unconstitutional authority over us, has been
      familiar to Americans from the first settlement of the country."
    </p>
    <p>
      There is, then, a predisposition, a latent or potential Americanism which
      existed long before the United States came into being. Now that our
      political unity has become a fact, the predisposition is certain to be
      regarded by our own and by future generations as evidence of a state of
      mind which made our separate national life inevitable. Yet to Thomas
      Hutchinson, a sound historian and honest man, the last Royal Governor of
      Massachusetts, a separate national life seemed in 1770 an unspeakable
      error and calamity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The seventeenth-century colonists were predominantly English, in blood, in
      traditions, and in impulses. Whether we look at Virginia or Plymouth or at
      the other colonies that were planted in swift succession along the
      seaboard, it is clear that we are dealing primarily with men of the
      English race. Most of them would have declared, with as much emphasis as
      Francis Hopkinson a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
      century later, "We of America are in all respects Englishmen." Professor
      Edward Channing thinks that it took a century of exposure to colonial
      conditions to force the English in America away from the traditions and
      ideals of those who continued to live in the old land. But the student of
      literature must keep constantly in mind that these English colonizers
      represented no single type of the national character. There were many men
      of many minds even within the contracted cabin of the <i>Mayflower</i>.
      The "sifted wheat" was by no means all of the same variety.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Old England was never more torn by divergent thought and subversive
      act than in the period between the death of Elizabeth in 1603 and the
      Revolution of 1688. In this distracted time who could say what was really
      "English"? Was it James the First or Raleigh? Archbishop Laud or John
      Cotton? Charles the First or Cromwell? Charles the Second or William Penn?
      Was it Churchman, Presbyterian, Independent, Separatist, Quaker? One is
      tempted to say that the title of Ben Jonson's comedy <i>Every Man in his
      Humour</i> became the standard of action for two whole generations of
      Englishmen, and that there is no common denominator for emigrants of such
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span> varied
      pattern as Smith and Sandys of Virginia, Morton of Merrymount, John
      Winthrop, "Sir" Christopher Gardiner and Anne Hutchinson of Boston, and
      Roger Williams of Providence. They seem as miscellaneous as "Kitchener's
      Army."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that we can make certain distinctions. Virginia, as has often
      been said, was more like a continuation of English society, while New
      England represented a digression from English society. There were then, as
      now, "stand-patters" and "progressives." It was the second class who,
      while retaining very conservative notions about property, developed a
      fearless intellectual radicalism which has written itself into the history
      of the United States. But to the student of early American literature all
      such generalizations are of limited value. He is dealing with individual
      men, not with "Cavalier" or "Roundhead" as such. He has learned from
      recent historians to distrust any such facile classification of the first
      colonists. He knows by this time that there were aristocrats in
      Massachusetts and commoners in Virginia; that the Pilgrims of Plymouth
      were more tolerant than the Puritans of Boston, and that Rhode Island was
      more tolerant than either. Yet useful as these general statements may be,
      the interpreter <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
      of men of letters must always go back of the racial type or the social
      system to the individual person. He recognizes, as a truth for him, that
      theory of creative evolution which holds that in the ascending progress of
      the race each thinking person becomes a species by himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      While something is gained, then, by remembering that the racial instincts
      and traditions of the first colonists were overwhelmingly English, and
      that their political and ethical views were the product of a turbulent and
      distraught time, it is even more important to note how the physical
      situation of the colonists affected their intellectual and moral, as well
      as their political problems. Among the emigrants from England, as we have
      seen, there were great varieties of social status, religious opinion,
      individual motive. But at least they all possessed the physical courage
      and moral hardihood to risk the dangerous voyage, the fearful hardships,
      and the vast uncertainties of the new life. To go out at all, under the
      pressure of any motive, was to meet triumphantly a searching test. It was
      in truth a "sifting," and though a few picturesque rascals had the courage
      to go into exile while a few saints may have been deterred, it is a truism
      to say that the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
      pioneers were made up of brave men and braver women.
    </p>
    <p>
      It cannot be asserted that their courage was the result of any single,
      dominating motive, equally operative in all of the colonies. Mrs. Hemans's
      familiar line about seeking "freedom to worship God" was measurably true
      of the Pilgrims of Plymouth, about whom she was writing. But the far more
      important Puritan emigration to Massachusetts under Winthrop aimed not so
      much at "freedom" as at the establishment of a theocracy according to the
      Scriptures. These men straightway denied freedom of worship, not only to
      newcomers who sought to join them, but to those members of their own
      company who developed independent ways of thinking. The list of motives
      for emigration ran the whole gamut, from missionary fervor for converting
      the savages, down through a commendable desire for gain, to the perhaps no
      less praiseworthy wish to escape a debtor's prison or the pillory. A few
      of the colonists were rich. Some were beggars or indentured servants. Most
      of them belonged to the middle class. John Harvard was the son of a
      butcher; Thomas Shepard, the son of a grocer; Roger Williams, the son of a
      tailor. But all three were <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17"
      id="Page_17">17</a></span> university bred and were natural leaders of
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once arrived in the wilderness, the pioneer life common to all of the
      colonists began instantly to exert its slow, irresistible pressure upon
      their minds and to mould them into certain ways of thinking and feeling.
      Without some perception of these modes of thought and emotion a knowledge
      of the spirit of our literature is impossible. Take, for instance, the
      mere physical situation of the first colonists, encamped on the very beach
      of the wide ocean with an illimitable forest in their rear. Their
      provisions were scanty. They grew watchful of the strange soil, of the new
      skies, of the unknown climate. Even upon the voyage over, John Winthrop
      thought that "the declination of the pole star was much, even to the view,
      beneath that it is in England," and that "the new moon, when it first
      appeared, was much smaller than at any time he had seen it in England."
      Here was a man evidently using his eyes with a new interest in natural
      phenomena. Under these changed skies the mind began gradually to change
      also.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first the colonists felt themselves an outpost of Europe, a forlorn
      hope of the Protestant Reformation. "We shall be as a city upon a hill,"
      said <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
      Winthrop. "The eyes of all people are upon us." Their creed was Calvinism,
      then in its third generation of dominion and a European doctrine which was
      not merely theological but social and political. The emigrant Englishmen
      were soon to discover that it contained a doctrine of human rights based
      upon human needs. At the beginning of their novel experience they were
      doubtless unaware of any alteration in their theories. But they were
      facing a new situation, and that new situation became an immense factor in
      their unconscious growth. Their intellectual and moral problems shifted,
      as a boat shifts her ballast when the wind blows from a new quarter. The
      John Cotton preaching in a shed in the new Boston had come to "suffer a
      sea-change" from the John Cotton who had been rector of St. Botolph's
      splendid church in Lincolnshire. The "church without a bishop" and the
      "state without a king" became a different church and state from the old,
      however loyally the ancient forms and phrases were retained.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the political problems of equality which were latent in Calvinism now
      began to take on a different meaning under the democratic conditions of
      pioneer life, the inner, spiritual problems of that amazing creed were
      intensified. "Fallen" human <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19"
      id="Page_19">19</a></span> nature remained the same, whether in the
      crowded cosmopolitan streets of Holland and London, or upon the desolate
      shores of Cape Cod. But the moral strain of the old insoluble conflict
      between "fixed fate" and "free will" was heightened by the physical
      loneliness of the colonists. Each soul must fight its own unaided,
      unending battle. In that moral solitude, as in the physical solitude of
      the settlers upon the far northwestern prairies of a later epoch, many a
      mind snapped. Unnatural tension was succeeded by unnatural crimes. But for
      the stronger intellects New England Calvinism became a potent spiritual
      gymnastic, where, as in the Swedish system of bodily training, one lifts
      imaginary and ever-increasing weights with imaginary and ever-increasing
      effort, flexor and extensor muscles pulling against one another, driven by
      the will. Calvinism bred athletes as well as maniacs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new situation, again, turned many of the theoretical speculations of
      the colonists into practical issues. Here, for example, was the Indian.
      Was he truly a child of God, possessing a soul, and, if so, had he
      partaken of the sin of Adam? These questions perplexed the saintly Eliot
      and the generous Roger Williams. But before many <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span> years the query as to whether a
      Pequot warrior had a soul became suddenly less important than the
      practical question as to whether the Pequot should be allowed any further
      chances of taking the white man's scalp. On this last issue the colonists
      were unanimous in the negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be easy to multiply such instances of a gradual change of view.
      But beneath all the changes and all the varieties of individual behavior
      in the various colonies that began to dot the seaboard, certain qualities
      demanded by the new surroundings are felt in colonial life and in colonial
      writings. One of these is the instinct for order, or at least that degree
      of order essential to the existence of a camp. It was not in vain that
      John Smith sought to correct the early laxness at Jamestown by the stern
      edict: "He that will not work, neither shall he eat." Dutch and Quaker
      colonies taught the same inexorable maxim of thrift. Soon there was work
      enough for all, at good wages, but the lesson had been taught. It gave
      Franklin's <i>Poor Richard</i> mottoes their flavor of homely, experienced
      truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Order in daily life led straight to political order, just as the equality
      and resourcefulness of the frontier, stimulated by isolation from Europe,
      led <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span> to
      political independence. The pioneer learned to make things for himself
      instead of sending to London for them, and by and by he grew as impatient
      of waiting for a political edict from London as he would become in waiting
      for a London plough. "This year," wrote one colonist, "ye will go to
      complain to the Parliament, and the next year they will send to see how it
      is, and the third year the government is changed." The time was coming
      when no more complaints would be sent.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most startling instances of this colonial instinct for
      self-government is the case of Thomas Hooker. Trained in Emmanuel College
      of the old Cambridge, he arrived in the new Cambridge in 1633. He grew
      restless under its theocratic government, being, it was said, "a person
      who when he was doing his Master's work would put a king into his pocket."
      So he led the famous migration of 1636 from Massachusetts to Hartford, and
      there helped to create a federation of independent towns which made their
      own constitution without mentioning any king, and became one of the
      corner-stones of American democracy. In May, 1638, Hooker declared in a
      sermon before the General Court "that the choice of public magistrates
      belongs unto the people by God's <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22"
      id="Page_22">22</a></span> own allowance," and "that they who have the
      power to appoint officers and magistrates, it is in their power, also, to
      set the bounds and limitations of the power and place into which they call
      them." The reason of this is: "<em>Because the foundation of authority is
      laid, firstly, in the free consent of the people.</em>" This high
      discourse antedates the famous pamphlets on liberty by Milton. It is a
      half-century earlier than Locke's <i>Treatise on Government</i>, a century
      and a quarter earlier than Rousseau's <i>Contrat Social</i>, and it
      precedes by one hundred and thirty-eight years the American Declaration of
      Independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the slightest acquaintance with colonial writings will reveal the fact
      that such political radicalism as Thomas Hooker's was accompanied by an
      equally striking conservatism in other directions. One of these
      conservative traits was the pioneer's respect for property, and
      particularly for the land cleared by his own toil. Gladstone once spoke of
      possession of the soil as the most important and most operative of all
      social facts. Free-footed as the pioneer colonist was, he was disinclined
      to part with his land without a substantial price for it. The land at his
      disposal was practically illimitable, but he showed a very <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span> English
      tenacity in safeguarding his hold upon his own portion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very English, likewise, was his attachment to the old country as "home."
      The lighter and the more serious writings of the colonists are alike in
      their respect for the past. In the New England settlements, although not
      at first in Virginia, there was respect for learning and for an educated
      clergy. The colonists revered the Bible. They maintained a stubborn regard
      for the Common Law of England. Even amid all the excitement of a
      successful rebellion from the mother country, this Common Law still held
      the Americans to the experience of the inescapable past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, as the reader of today lifts his eyes from the pages of the books
      written in America during the seventeenth century, and tries to meditate
      upon the general difference between them and the English books written
      during the same period, he will be aware of the firmness with which the
      conservative forces held on this side of the Atlantic. It was only one
      hundred years from the Great Armada of 1588 to the flight of James Second,
      the last of the Stuart Kings. With that Revolution of 1688 the struggles
      characteristic of the seventeenth century in England came to an end. A new
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span> working
      basis is found for thought, politics, society, literature. But while those
      vast changes had been shaking England, two generations of American
      colonists had cleared their forests, fought the savages, organized their
      townships and their trade, put money in their purses, and lived, though as
      yet hardly suspecting it, a life that was beginning to differentiate them
      from the men of the Old World. We must now glance at the various aspects
      of this isolated life of theirs, as it is revealed in their books.

      The First Colonial Literature
    </p>
    <p class="noindent">
      <span class="smcap">The</span> simplest and oldest group of colonial
      writings is made up of records of exploration and adventure. They are like
      the letters written from California in 1849 to the "folks back East."
      Addressed to home-keeping Englishmen across the sea, they describe the new
      world, explain the present situation of the colonists, and express their
      hopes for the future. Captain John Smith's <i>True Relation</i>, already
      alluded to, is the typical production of this class: a swift marching
      book, full of eager energy, of bluff and breezy picturesqueness, and of
      triumphant instinct for the main chance. Like most of the Elizabethans, he
      cannot help poetizing in his prose. Cod-fishing is to him a "sport"; "and
      what sport doth yeald a more pleasing content, and lesse hurt or charge
      then angling with a hooke, and crossing the sweete ayre from Isle to Isle,
      over the silent streams of a calme Sea?" But the <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span> gallant Captain is also capable
      of very plain speech, Cromwellian in its simplicity, as when he writes
      back to the London stockholders of the Virginia Company: "When you send
      again, I entreat you rather send but thirty carpenters, husbandmen,
      gardeners, fishermen, blacksmiths, masons, and diggers up of trees' roots,
      well provided, than a thousand of such as we have."
    </p>
    <p>
      America was but an episode in the wide wanderings of Captain Smith, but he
      owes his place in human memory today to the physical and mental energy
      with which he met the demands of a new situation, and to the vividness
      with which he dashed down in words whatever his eyes had seen. Whether, in
      that agreeable passage about Pocahontas, he was guilty of romancing a
      little, no one really knows, but the Captain, as the first teller of this
      peculiarly American type of story, will continue to have an indulgent
      audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      But other exiles in Virginia were skillful with the pen. William
      Strachey's <i>True Reportory of the Wrack of Sir Thomas Gates, Kt., vpon
      and from the islands of the Bermudas</i> may or may not have given a hint
      to Shakespeare for the storm-scene in <i>The Tempest</i>. In either case
      it is admirable writing, flexible, sensitive, shrewdly observant.
      Whitaker, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
      the apostle of Virginia, mingles, like many a missionary of the present
      day, the style of an exhorter with a keen discernment of the traits of the
      savage mind. George Percy, fresh from Northumberland, tells in a language
      as simple as Defoe's the piteous tale of five months of illness and
      starvation, watched by "those wild and cruel Pagans." John Pory, of "the
      strong potations," who thinks that "good company is the soul of this
      life," nevertheless comforts himself in his solitude among the "crystal
      rivers and odoriferous woods" by reflecting that he is escaping envy and
      expense. George Sandys, scholar and poet, finds his solace during a
      Virginia exile in continuing his translation of Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i>.
      Colonel Norwood, an adventurer who belongs to a somewhat later day, since
      he speaks of having "read Mr. Smith's travels," draws the long bow of
      narrative quite as powerfully as the redoubtable Smith, and far more
      smoothly, as witness his accounts of starvation on shipboard and
      cannibalism on shore. This Colonel is an artist who would have delighted
      Stevenson.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of these early tellers of Virginia tales were Englishmen, and most of
      them returned to England, where their books were printed and their
      remaining lives were passed. But far to the northeast <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span> of Virginia there were two
      colonies of men who earned the right to say, in William Bradford's quiet
      words, "It is not with us as with other men, whom small things can
      discourage, or small discontentments cause to wish themselves at home
      again." One was the colony of Pilgrims at Plymouth, headed by Bradford
      himself. The other was the Puritan colony of Massachusetts Bay, with John
      Winthrop as governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradford and Winthrop have left journals which are more than chronicles of
      adventure. They record the growth and government of a commonwealth. Both
      Bradford and Winthrop were natural leaders of men, grave, dignified,
      solid, endowed with a spirit that bred confidence. Each was learned.
      Winthrop, a lawyer and man of property, had a higher social standing than
      Bradford, who was one of the Separatists of Robinson's flock at Leyden.
      But the Pilgrim of the <i>Mayflower</i> and the well-to-do Puritan of the
      Bay Colony both wrote their annals like gentlemen and scholars. Bradford's
      <i>History of Plymouth Plantation</i> runs from 1620 to 1647. Winthrop's
      diary, now printed as the <i>History of New England</i>, begins with his
      voyage in 1630 and closes in the year of his death, 1649. As records of an
      Anglo-Saxon <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
      experiment in self-government under pioneer conditions these books are
      priceless; as human documents, they illuminate the Puritan character; as
      for "literary" value in the narrow sense of that word, neither Bradford
      nor Winthrop seems to have thought of literary effect. Yet the leader of
      the Pilgrims has passages of grave sweetness and charm, and his sketch of
      his associate, Elder Brewster, will bear comparison with the best English
      biographical writing of that century. Winthrop is perhaps more varied in
      tone, as he is in matter, but he writes throughout as a ruler of men
      should write, with "decent plainness and manly freedom." His best known
      pages, justly praised by Tyler and other historians of American thought,
      contain his speech before the General Court in 1645 on the nature of true
      liberty. No paragraphs written in America previous to the Revolution would
      have given more pleasure to Abraham Lincoln, but it is to be feared that
      Lincoln never saw Governor Winthrop's book, though his own ancestor,
      Samuel Lincoln of Hingham, lived under Winthrop's jurisdiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The theory of government held by the dominant party of the first two
      generations of New England pioneers has often been called a "theocracy,"
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span> that is
      to say, a government according to the Word of God as expounded and
      enforced by the clergy. The experiment was doomed to ultimate failure, for
      it ran counter to some of the noblest instincts of human nature. But its
      administration was in the hands of able men. The power of the clergy was
      well-nigh absolute. The political organization of the township depended
      upon the ecclesiastical organization as long as the right to vote was
      confined to church members. How sacrosanct and awful was the position of
      the clergyman may be perceived from Hawthorne's <i>The Minister's Black
      Veil</i> and <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it must be said that men like Hooker and Cotton, Shepard and Norton,
      had every instinct and capacity for leadership. With the notable exception
      of Hooker, such men were aristocrats, holding John Winthrop's opinion that
      "Democracy is, among most civil nations, accounted the meanest and worst
      form of government." They were fiercely intolerant. The precise reason for
      the Hooker migration from Cambridge to Hartford in 1636&mdash;the very
      year of the founding of Harvard&mdash;was prudently withheld, but it is
      now thought to be the instinct of escape from the clerical architects of
      the Cambridge Platform. Yet no one <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31"
      id="Page_31">31</a></span> would today call Thomas Hooker a liberal in
      religion, pioneer in political liberty though he proved to be. His extant
      sermons have the steady stroke of a great hammer; smiting at the mind and
      heart. "Others because they have felt the heavy hand of God &hellip; upon
      these grounds they build their hopes: 'I have had my hell in this life,
      and I hope to have heaven in the world to come; I hope the worst is
      over.'" Not so, thunders the preacher in reply: "Sodom and Gomorrah they
      burnt in brimstone and they shall burn in hell." One of Hooker's
      successors has called him "a son of thunder and a son of consolation by
      turns." The same may be said of Thomas Shepard, another graduate of
      Emmanuel College in the old Cambridge, who became the "soul-melting
      preacher" of the newer Cambridge by the Charles. Pure, ravishing notes of
      spiritual devotion still sing themselves in his pages. He is wholly
      Calvinist. He thinks "the truth is a poor mean thing in itself" and that
      the human reason cannot be "the last resolution of all doubts," which must
      be sought only in the written Word of God. He holds it "a tough work, a
      wonderful hard matter to be saved." "Jesus Christ is not got with a wet
      finger." Yet, like so many mystics, he yearns to be "covered <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span> with God, as
      with a cloud," to be "drowned, plunged, and swallowed up with God." One
      hundred years later we shall find this same rhapsodic ecstasy in the
      meditations of Jonathan Edwards.

    <p>
      John Cotton, the third of the mighty men in the early Colonial pulpit,
      owes his fame more to his social and political influence than to his
      literary power. Yet even that was thought commanding. Trained, like Hooker
      and Shepard, at Emmanuel College, and fresh from the rectorship of St.
      Botolph's in the Lincolnshire Boston, John Cotton dominated that new
      Boston which was named in his honor. He became the Pope of the theocracy;
      a clever Pope and not an unkindly one. He seems to have shared some of the
      opinions of Anne Hutchinson, though he "pronounced the sentence of
      admonition" against her, says Winthrop, with much zeal and detestation of
      her errors. Hawthorne, in one of his ironic moods, might have done justice
      to this scene. Cotton was at heart too liberal for his r&ocirc;le of
      Primate, and fate led him to persecute a man whose very name has become a
      symbol of victorious tolerance, Roger Williams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Williams, known today as a friend of Cromwell, Milton, and Sir Harry Vane,
      had been exiled from <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
      Massachusetts for maintaining that the civil power had no jurisdiction
      over conscience. This doctrine was fatal to the existence of a theocratic
      state dominated by the church. John Cotton was perfectly logical in
      "enlarging" Roger Williams into the wilderness, but he showed less than
      his usual discretion in attacking the quick-tempered Welshman in
      pamphlets. It was like asking Hotspur if he would kindly consent to fight.
      Back and forth the books fly, for Williams loves this game. His <i>Bloody
      Tenet of Persecution for Cause of Conscience</i> calls forth Mr. Cotton's
      <i>Bloody Tenet washed and made white in the Blood of the Lamb</i>; and
      this in turn provokes the torrential flood of Williams's masterpiece, <i>The
      Bloody Tenet yet more Bloody, by Mr. Cotton's endeavor to wash it white in
      the Blood of the Lamb</i>. There is glorious writing here, and its effect
      cannot be suggested by quoting sentences. But there is one sentence in a
      letter written by Williams in his old age to his fellow-townsmen of
      Providence which points the whole moral of the terrible mistake made by
      the men who sought spiritual liberty in America for themselves, only to
      deny that same liberty to others. "I have only one motion and petition,"
      begs this veteran pioneer who had forded many a swollen stream and built
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span> many a
      rude bridge in the Plantations: "it is this, that after you have got over
      the black brook of some soul bondage yourselves, you tear not down the
      bridge after you."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is for such wise and humane counsels as this that Roger Williams is
      remembered. His opponents had mightier intellects than his, but the world
      has long since decided against them. Colonial sermon literature is read
      today chiefly by antiquarians who have no sympathy for the creed which
      once gave it vitality. Its theology, like the theology of <i>Paradise Lost</i>
      or the <i>Divine Comedy</i>, has sunk to the bottom of the black brook.
      But we cannot judge fairly the contemporary effect of this pulpit
      literature without remembering the passionate faith that made pulpit and
      pews copartners in a supreme spiritual struggle. Historians properly
      insist upon the &aelig;sthetic poverty of the New England Puritans; that
      their rule of life cut them off from an enjoyment of the dramatic
      literature of their race, then just closing its most splendid epoch; that
      they had little poetry or music and no architecture and plastic art. But
      we must never forget that to men of their creed the Sunday sermons and the
      week-day "lectures" served as oratory, poetry, and drama. These <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span> outpourings
      of the mind and heart of their spiritual leaders were the very stuff of
      human passion in its intensest forms. Puritan churchgoers, passing hours
      upon hours every week in rapt absorption with the noblest of all poetry
      and prose in the pages of their chief book, the Bible, were at least as
      sensitive to the beauty of words and the sweep of emotions as our
      contemporaries upon whose book-shelves Spenser and Milton stand unread.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is only by entering into the psychology of the period that we can
      estimate its attitude towards the poetry written by the pioneers
      themselves. The <i>Bay Psalm Book</i> (1640), the first book printed in
      the colonies, is a wretched doggerel arrangement of the magnificent King
      James Version of the Psalms, designed to be sung in churches. Few of the
      New England churches could sing more than half-a-dozen tunes, and a
      pitch-pipe was for a long time the only musical instrument allowed. Judged
      as hymnology or poetry, the <i>Bay Psalm Book</i> provokes a smile. But
      the men and women who used it as a handbook of devotion sang it with their
      hearts aflame. In judging such a popular seventeenth-century poem as
      Wigglesworth's <i>Day of Doom</i> one must strip oneself quite free from
      the twentieth century, and pretend to be sitting in the <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
      chimney-corner of a Puritan kitchen, reading aloud by that firelight
      which, as Lowell once humorously suggested, may have added a "livelier
      relish" to the poet's "premonitions of eternal combustion." Lowell could
      afford to laugh about it, having crossed that particular black brook. But
      for several generations the boys and girls of New England had read the <i>Day
      of Doom</i> as if Mr. Wigglesworth, the gentle and somewhat sickly
      minister of Malden, had veritably peeped into Hell. It is the present
      fashion to underestimate the power of Wigglesworth's verse. At its best it
      has a trampling, clattering shock like a charge of cavalry and a sound
      like clanging steel. Mr. Kipling and other cunning ballad-makers have
      imitated the peculiar rhyme structure chosen by the nervous little parson.
      But no living poet can move his readers to the fascinated horror once felt
      by the Puritans as they followed Wigglesworth's relentless gaze into the
      future of the soul's destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Historical curiosity may still linger, of course, over other verse-writers
      of the period. Anne Bradstreet's poems, for instance, are not without
      grace and womanly sweetness, in spite of their didactic themes and
      portentous length. But this <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37"
      id="Page_37">37</a></span> lady, born in England, the daughter of Governor
      Dudley and later the wife of Governor Bradstreet, chose to imitate the
      more fantastic of the moralizing poets of England and France. There is
      little in her hundreds of pages which seems today the inevitable outcome
      of her own experience in the New World. For readers who like roughly
      mischievous satire, of a type initiated in England by Bishop Hall and
      Donne, there is <i>The Simple Cobbler of Agawam</i> written by the roving
      clergyman Nathaniel Ward. But he lived only a dozen years in
      Massachusetts, and his satirical pictures are scarcely more "American"
      than the satire upon German professors in <i>Sartor Resartus</i> is
      "German." Like Charles Dickens's <i>American Notes</i>, Ward's give the
      reaction of a born Englishman in the presence of the sights and the talk
      and the personages of the transatlantic world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the colonial writings of the seventeenth century, those that have
      lost least of their interest through the lapse of years are narratives of
      struggles with the Indians. The image of the "bloody savage" has always
      hovered in the background of the American imagination. Our boys and girls
      have "played Indian" from the beginning, and the actual Indian is still
      found, as for three hundred years past, <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span> upon the frontier fringe of our
      civilization. Novelists like Cooper, historians like Parkman, poets like
      Longfellow, have dealt with the rich material offered by the life of the
      aborigines, but the long series begins with the scribbled story of
      colonists. Here are comedy and tragedy, plain narratives of trading and
      travel, missionary zeal and triumphs; then the inevitable alienation of
      the two races and the doom of the native.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "noble savage" note may be found in John Rolfe, the husband of
      Pocahontas, with whom, poor fellow, his "best thoughts are so intangled
      and enthralled." Other Virginians, like Smith, Strachey, and Percy, show
      close naturalistic observation, touched with the abounding Elizabethan
      zest for novelties. To Alexander Whitaker, however, these "naked slaves of
      the devil" were "not so simple as some have supposed." He yearned and
      labored over their souls, as did John Eliot and Roger Williams and Daniel
      Gookin of New England. In the Pequot War of 1637 the grim settlers
      resolved to be rid of that tribe once for all, and the narratives of
      Captain Edward Johnson and Captain John Mason, who led in the storming and
      slaughter at the Indians' Mystic Fort, are as piously relentless as
      anything in the Old Testament. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39"
      id="Page_39">39</a></span> Cromwell at Drogheda, not long after, had
      soldiers no more merciless than these exterminating Puritans, who wished
      to plough their fields henceforth in peace. A generation later the storm
      broke again in King Philip's War. Its tales of massacre, captivity, and
      single-handed fighting linger in the American imagination still. Typical
      pamphlets are Mary Rowlandson's thrilling tale of the Lancaster massacre
      and her subsequent captivity, and the loud-voiced Captain Church's
      unvarnished description of King Philip's death. The King, shot down like a
      wearied bull-moose in the deep swamp, "fell upon his face in the mud and
      water, with his gun under him." They "drew him through the mud to the
      upland; and a doleful, great, naked dirty beast he looked like." The head
      brought only thirty shillings at Plymouth: "scanty reward and poor
      encouragement," thought Captain Church. William Hubbard, the minister of
      Ipswich, wrote a comprehensive <i>Narrative of the Troubles with the
      Indians in New England</i>, bringing the history down to 1677. Under the
      better known title of <i>Indian Wars</i>, this fervid and dramatic tale,
      penned in a quiet parsonage, has stirred the pulses of every succeeding
      generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span> The
      close of King Philip's War, 1676, coinciding as it does with Bacon's
      Rebellion in Virginia, marks an era in the development of our independent
      life. The events of that year, in the words of Professor Tyler,
      "established two very considerable facts, namely, that English colonists
      in America could be so provoked as to make physical resistance to the
      authority of England, and, second, that English colonists in America
      could, in the last resort, put down any combination of Indians that might
      be formed against them. In other words, it was then made evident that
      English colonists would certainly be safe in the new world, and also that
      they would not always be colonists."
    </p>
    <p>
      While the end of an historical or literary era cannot always be thus
      conveniently indicated by a date, there is no doubt that the final quarter
      of the seventeenth century witnessed deep changes in the outward life and
      the inner temper of the colonists. The "first fine careless rapture" was
      over. Only a few aged men could recall the memory of the first
      settlements. Between the founding of Jamestown and the rebellion under the
      leadership of Nathaniel Bacon almost seventy years had intervened, an
      interval corresponding to that which separates us from the Mexican War.
      Roger Williams <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
      ended his much-enduring and beneficent life in the flourishing town of
      Providence in 1684. He had already outlived Cotton and Hooker, Shepard and
      Winthrop, by more than thirty years. Inevitably men began, toward the end
      of the century, to take stock of the great venture of colonization, to
      scrutinize their own history and present position, to ask searching
      questions of themselves. "You have better food and raiment than was in
      former times," wrote the aged Roger Clark, in 1676; "but have you better
      hearts than your forefathers had?" Thomas Walley's <i>Languishing
      Commonwealth</i> maintains that "Faith is dead, and Love is cold, and Zeal
      is gone." Urian Oakes's election sermon of 1670 in Cambridge is a
      condemnation of the prevalent worldliness and ostentation. This period of
      critical inquiry and assessment, however, also gives grounds for just
      pride. History, biography, eulogy, are flourishing. The reader is reminded
      of that epoch, one hundred and fifty years later, when the deaths of John
      Adams and of Thomas Jefferson, falling upon the same anniversary day, the
      Fourth of July, 1826, stirred all Americans to a fresh recognition of the
      services wrought by the Fathers of the Republic. So it was in the colonies
      at the close of the seventeenth century. <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span> Old England, in one final
      paroxysm of political disgust, cast out the last Stuart in 1688. That
      Revolution marks, as we have seen, the close of a long and tragic struggle
      which began in the autocratic theories of James the First and in the
      absolutism of Charles. Almost every phase of that momentous conflict had
      its reverberation across the Atlantic, as the history of the granting and
      withdrawal of colonial charters witnesses abundantly. The American
      pioneers were quite aware of what was going on in England, and they
      praised God or grumbled, thriftily profited by the results or quietly
      nullified them, as the case might be. But all the time, while England was
      rocked to its foundations, the colonists struck steadily forward into
      their own independent life.

      The Third and Fourth Generation
    </p>
    <p class="noindent">
      <span class="smcap">When</span> the eighteenth century opened, many signs
      of change were in the air. The third generation of native-born Americans
      was becoming secularized. The theocracy of New England had failed. In the
      height of the tragic folly over the supposed "witchcraft" in Salem,
      Increase Mather and his son Cotton had held up the hands of the judges in
      their implacable work. But before five years had passed, Judge Sewall does
      public penance in church for his share of the awful blunder, desiring "to
      take the shame and blame of it." Robert Calef's cool pamphlet exposing the
      weakness of the prosecutors' case is indeed burned by Increase Mather in
      the Harvard Yard, but the liberal party are soon to force Mather from the
      Presidency and to refuse that office to his son. In the town of Boston,
      once hermetically sealed against heresy, there are Baptist and Episcopal
      churches&mdash;and a dancing-master. <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span> Young Benjamin Franklin, born in
      1706, professes a high respect for the Mathers, but he does not go to
      church, "Sunday being my studying day," and neither the clerical nor the
      secular arm of Boston is long enough and strong enough to compel that
      industrious apprentice into piety.
    </p>
    <p>
      If such was the state of New England, the laxity of New York and Virginia
      needs little evidence. Contemporary travelers found the New Yorkers
      singularly attached to the things of this present world. Philadelphia was
      prosperous and therewith content. Virginia was a paradise with no
      forbidden fruit. Hugh Jones, writing of it in 1724, considers North
      Carolina "the refuge of runaways," and South Carolina "the delight of
      buccaneers and pirates," but Virginia "the happy retreat of true Britons
      and true Churchmen." Unluckily these Virginians, well nourished "by the
      plenty of the country," have "contemptible notions of England!" We shall
      hear from them again. In the meantime the witty William Byrd of Westover
      describes for us his amusing survey of the Dismal Swamp, and his
      excursions into North Carolina and to Governor Spotswood's iron mines,
      where he reads aloud to the Widow Fleming, on a rainy autumn day, three
      acts of the <i>Beggars' Opera</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45"
      id="Page_45">45</a></span> just over from London. So runs the world away,
      south of the Potomac. Thackeray paints it once for all, no doubt, in the
      opening chapters of <i>The Virginians</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To discover any ambitious literary effort in this period, we must turn
      northward again. In the middle colonies, and especially in Philadelphia,
      which had now outgrown Boston in population, there was a quickened
      interest in education and science. But the New Englanders were still the
      chief makers of books. Three great names will sufficiently represent the
      age: Cotton Mather, a prodigy of learning whose eyes turn back fondly to
      the provincial past; Jonathan Edwards, perhaps the most consummate
      intellect of the eighteenth century; and Benjamin Franklin, certainly the
      most perfect exponent of its many-sided life.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Cotton Mather was graduated from Harvard in 1678, in his sixteenth
      year, he was publicly complimented by President Oakes, in fulsome Latin,
      as the grandson of Richard Mather and John Cotton. This atmosphere of
      flattery, this consciousness of continuing in his own person the famous
      local dynasty, surrounded and sustained him to the end. He had a less
      commanding personality than his father Increase. His nervous sensibility
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span> was
      excessive. His natural vanity was never subdued, though it was often
      chastened by trial and bitter disappointment. But, like his father, he was
      an omnivorous reader and a facile producer of books, carrying daily such
      burdens of mental and spiritual excitement as would have crushed a normal
      man. Increase Mather published some one hundred and fifty books and
      pamphlets: Cotton Mather not less than four hundred. The Rev. John Norton,
      in his sketch of John Cotton, remarks that "the hen, which brings not
      forth without uncessant sitting night and day, is an apt emblem of
      students." Certainly the hen is an apt emblem of the "uncessant" sitter,
      the credulous scratcher, the fussy cackler who produced the <i>Magnalia</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he had certain elements of greatness. His tribal loyalty was perfect.
      His ascetic devotion to his conception of religious truth was absolute.
      His <i>Diary</i>, which has recently been published in full, records his
      concern for the chief political events in Europe in his day, no less than
      his brooding solicitude for the welfare of his townspeople, and his agony
      of spirit over the lapses of his wayward eldest son. A "sincere" man,
      then, as Carlyle would say, at bottom; but overlaid with such <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span> "Jewish old
      clothes," such professional robings and personal plumage as makes it
      difficult, save in the revealing <i>Diary</i>, to see the man himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Magnalia Christi Americana</i>, treating the history of New England
      from 1620 to 1698, was published in a tall London folio of nearly 800
      pages in 1702. It is divided into seven books, and proceeds, by methods
      entirely unique, to tell of Pilgrim and Puritan divines and governors, of
      Harvard College, of the churches of New England, of marvelous events, of
      Indian wars; and in general to justify, as only a member of the Mather
      dynasty could justify, the ways of God to Boston men. Hawthorne and
      Whittier, Longfellow and Lowell knew this book well and found much honey
      in the vast carcass. To have had four such readers and a biographer like
      Barrett Wendell must be gratifying to Cotton Mather in Paradise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Diary</i> of Mather's fellow-townsman Judge Samuel Sewall has been
      read more generally in recent years than anything written by Mather
      himself. It was begun in 1673, nine years earlier than the first entry in
      Mather's <i>Diary</i>, and it ends in 1729, while Mather's closes in 1724.
      As a picture of everyday happenings in New England, Sewall's <i>Diary</i>
      is as far superior to Mather's as <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48"
      id="Page_48">48</a></span> Pepys's <i>Diary</i> is to George Fox's <i>Journal</i>
      in painting the England of the Restoration. Samuel Sewall was an admirably
      solid figure, keen, forceful, honest. Most readers of his <i>Diary</i>
      believe that he really was in luck when he was rejected by the Widow
      Winthrop on that fateful November day when his eye noted&mdash;in spite of
      his infatuation&mdash;that "her dress was not so clean as sometime it had
      been. Jehovah Jireh!"
    </p>
    <p>
      One pictures Cotton Mather as looking instinctively backward to the Heroic
      Age of New England with pious nervous exaltation, and Samuel Sewall as
      doing the day's work uprightly without taking anxious thought of either
      past or future. But Jonathan Edwards is set apart from these and other
      men. He is a lonely seeker after spiritual perfection, in quest of that
      city "far on the world's rim," as Masefield says of it, the city whose
      builder and maker is God.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story of Edwards's career has the simplicity and dignity of tragedy.
      Born in a parsonage in the quiet Connecticut valley in 1703&mdash;the year
      of John Wesley's birth&mdash;he is writing at the age of ten to disprove
      the doctrine of the materiality of the soul. At twelve he is studying "the
      wondrous way of the working of the spider," with a <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span> precision and enthusiasm which
      would have made him a great naturalist. At fourteen he begins his notes on
      <i>The Mind</i> and on <i>Natural Science</i>. He is graduated from Yale
      in 1720, studies theology, and at twenty-four becomes the colleague of his
      famous grandfather, Solomon Stoddard, in the church at Northampton. He
      marries the beautiful Sarah Pierrepont, whom he describes in his journal
      in a prose rhapsody which, like his mystical rhapsodies on religion in the
      same youthful period, glows with a clear unearthly beauty unmatched in any
      English prose of that century. For twenty-three years he serves the
      Northampton church, and his sermons win him the rank of the foremost
      preacher in New England. John Wesley reads at Oxford his account of the
      great revival of 1735. Whitefield comes to visit him at Northampton. Then,
      in 1750, the ascetic preacher alienates his church over issues pertaining
      to discipline and to the administration of the sacrament. He is dismissed.
      He preaches his "farewell sermon," like Wesley, like Emerson, like Newman,
      and many another still unborn. He removes to Stockbridge, then a hamlet in
      the wilderness, preaches to the Indians, and writes treatises on theology
      and metaphysics, among them the world-famous <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span> <i>Freedom of the Will</i>. In
      1757, upon the death of his son-in-law, President Aaron Burr of Princeton,
      Edwards is called to the vacant Presidency. He is reluctant to go, for
      though he is only fifty-four, his health has never been robust, and he has
      his great book on the <i>History of Redemption</i> still to write. But he
      accepts, finds the smallpox raging in Princeton upon his arrival in
      January, 1758, is inoculated, and dies of the disease in March&mdash;his
      dreams unfulfilled, his life-work once more thwarted. Close by the tomb of
      this saint is the tomb of his grandson, Aaron Burr, who killed Hamilton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The literary reputation of Jonathan Edwards has turned, like the
      vicissitudes of his life, upon factors that could not be foreseen. His
      contemporary fame was chiefly as a preacher, and was due to sermons like
      those upon <i>God Glorified in Man's Dependence</i> and <i>The Reality of
      Spiritual Life</i>, rather than to such discourses as the Enfield sermon,
      <i>Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God</i>, which in our own day is the
      best known of his deliverances. Legends have grown up around this terrific
      Enfield sermon. Its fearful power over its immediate hearers cannot be
      gainsaid, and it will long continue to be quoted as an example of the
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span> length
      to which a Calvinistic logician of genius was compelled by his own scheme
      to go. We still see the tall, sweet-faced man, worn by his daily twelve
      hours of intense mental toil, leaning on one elbow in the pulpit and
      reading from manuscript, without even raising his gentle voice, those
      words which smote his congregation into spasms of terror and which seem to
      us sheer blasphemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the <i>Farewell Sermon</i> of 1750 gives a more characteristic view of
      Edwards's mind and heart, and conveys an ineffaceable impression of his
      nobility of soul. His diction, like Wordsworth's, is usually plain almost
      to bareness; the formal framework of his discourses is obtruded; and he
      hunts objections to their last hiding-place with wearisome pertinacity.
      Yet his logic is incandescent. Steel sometimes burns to the touch like
      this, in the bitter winters of New England, and one wonders whether
      Edwards's brain was not of ice, so pitiless does it seem. His treatise
      denying the freedom of the will has given him a European reputation
      comparable with that enjoyed by Franklin in science and Jefferson in
      political propaganda. It was really a polemic demonstrating the
      sovereignty of God, rather than pure theology or metaphysics. Edwards goes
      beyond <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
      Augustine and Calvin in asserting the arbitrary will of the Most High and
      in "denying to the human will any self-determining power." He has been
      refuted by events and tendencies, such as the growth of historical
      criticism and the widespread acceptance of the doctrine of evolution,
      rather than by the might of any single antagonist. So, too, the Dred Scott
      decision of Chief Justice Taney, holding that the slave was not a citizen,
      was not so much answered by opponents as it was superseded by the
      arbitrament of war. But the idealism of this lonely thinker has entered
      deeply and permanently into the spiritual life of his countrymen, and he
      will continue to be read by a few of those who still read Plato and Dante.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My mother grieves," wrote Benjamin Franklin to his father in 1738, "that
      one of her sons is an Arian, another an Arminian. What an Arminian or an
      Arian is, I cannot say that I very well know. The truth is I make such
      distinctions very little my study." To understand Franklin's indifference
      to such distinctions, we must realize how completely he represents the
      secularizing tendencies of his age. What a drama of worldly adventure it
      all was, this roving life of the tallow-chandler's son, who runs away from
      home, walks the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
      streets of Philadelphia with the famous loaves of bread under his arm, is
      diligent in business, slips over to London, where he gives lessons in
      swimming and in total abstinence, slips back to Philadelphia and becomes
      its leading citizen, fights the long battle of the American colonies in
      London, sits in the Continental Congress, sails to Europe to arrange that
      French Alliance which brought our Revolution to a successful issue, and
      comes home at last, full of years and honors, to a bland and philosophical
      exit from the stage!
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke with every Puritan tradition. The Franklins were relatively late
      comers to New England. They sprang from a long line of blacksmiths at
      Ecton in Northamptonshire. The seat of the Washingtons was not far away,
      and Franklin's latest biographer points out that the pink-coated huntsmen
      of the Washington gentry may often have stopped at Ecton to have their
      horses shod at the Franklin smithy. Benjamin's father came out in 1685,
      more than fifty years after the most notable Puritan emigration. Young
      Benjamin, born in 1706, was as untouched by the ardors of that elder
      generation as he would have been by the visions of Dante&mdash;an author,
      by the way, whom he never mentions, even as he never <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span> mentions Shakespeare. He had no
      reverence for Puritan New England. To its moral beauty, its fine severity,
      he was wholly blind. As a boy he thriftily sold his <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>.
      He became, in the new fashion of that day, a Deist. Like a true child of
      the eighteenth century, his attitude toward the seventeenth was that of
      amused or contemptuous superiority. Thackeray has somewhere a charming
      phrase about his own love for the back seat of the stage-coach, the seat
      which, in the old coaching days, gave one a view of the receding
      landscape. Thackeray, like Burke before him, loved historical
      associations, historical sentiment, the backward look over the long road
      which humanity has traveled. But Franklin faced the other way. He would
      have endorsed his friend Jefferson's scornful sentence, "The dead have no
      rights." He joined himself wholly to that eighteenth century in which his
      own lot was cast, and, alike in his qualities and in his defects, he
      became one of its most perfect representatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      To catch the full spirit of that age, turn for an instant to the London of
      1724&mdash;the year of Franklin's arrival. Thirty-six years have elapsed
      since the glorious Revolution of 1688; the Whig principles, then
      triumphant, have been tacitly <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55"
      id="Page_55">55</a></span> accepted by both political parties; the
      Jacobite revolt of 1715 has proved a fiasco; the country has accepted the
      House of Hanover and a government by party leadership of the House of
      Commons, and it does not care whether Sir Robert Walpole buys a few rotten
      boroughs, so long as he maintains peace with Europe and prosperity at
      home. England is weary of seventeenth century "enthusiasm," weary of
      conflict, sick of idealism. She has found in the accepted Whig principles
      a satisfactory compromise, a working theory of society, a <i>modus vivendi</i>
      which nobody supposes is perfect but which will answer the prayer
      appointed to be read in all the churches, "Grant us peace in our time, O
      Lord." The theories to which men gave their lives in the seventeenth
      century seem ghostly in their unreality; but the prize turnips on Sir
      Robert's Norfolk farm, and the wines in his cellar, and the offices at his
      disposal&mdash;these are very real indeed. London merchants are making
      money; the squire and the parson are tranquilly ruling the country
      parishes; the philosophy of John Locke is everywhere triumphant. Mr. Pope
      is the poet of the hour, and his <i>Essay on Man</i>, counseling
      acceptance of our mortal situation, is considered to be the last word of
      human wisdom and of poetical elegance. In <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span> prose, the style of the <i>Spectator</i>
      rules&mdash;an admirable style, Franklin thought, and he imitated it
      patiently until its ease and urbanity had become his own. And indeed, how
      much of that London of the third decade of the century passed into the
      mind of the inquisitive, roving, loose-living printer's apprentice from
      Philadelphia! It taught him that the tangible world is the real world, and
      that nothing succeeds like success; but it never even whispered to him
      that sometimes nothing damns like success.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his limitations, no less than in his power of assimilation, Franklin
      was the representative man of his era. He had no artistic interests, no
      liking for metaphysics after his brief devotion, in early manhood, to the
      dialogues of Plato. He taught himself some Latin, but he came to believe
      that the classics had little significance and that they should be
      superseded by the modern languages. For the medi&aelig;val world he had no
      patience or understanding. To these defects of his century we must add
      some failings of his own. He was not always truthful. He had an indelible
      streak of coarseness. His conception of the "art of virtue" was
      mechanical. When Carlyle called Franklin the "father of all the Yankees,"
      we must <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
      remember that the Scotch prophet hated Yankees and believed that
      Franklin's smooth, plausible, trader type of morality was only a broad way
      to the everlasting bonfire.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is folly to linger over the limitations of the tallow-chandler's
      son. The catalogue of his beneficent activity is a vast one. Balzac once
      characterized him as the man who invented the lightning-rod, the hoax, and
      the republic. His contributions to science have to do with electricity,
      earthquakes, geology, meteorology, physics, chemistry, astronomy,
      mathematics, navigation of air and water, agriculture, medicine, and
      hygiene. In some of these fields he did pioneer work of lasting
      significance. His teachings of thrift and prudence, as formulated in the
      maxims of Poor Richard, gave him a world-wide reputation. He attacked war,
      like Voltaire, not so much for its wickedness as for its folly, and
      cheerfully gave up many years of a long life to the effort to promote a
      better understanding among the nations of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is perhaps needless to add what all persons who love good writing know,
      that Benjamin Franklin was a most delightful writer. His letters cover an
      amusing and extraordinary variety of <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span> topics. He ranges from balloons
      to summer hats, and from the advantages of deep ploughing to bifocal
      glasses, which, by the way, he invented. He argues for sharp razors and
      cold baths, and for fresh air in the sleeping-room. He discusses the
      morals of the game of chess, the art of swimming, the evils of smoky
      chimneys, the need of reformed spelling. Indeed, his passion for
      improvement led him not only to try his hand upon an abridgment of the
      Book of Common Prayer, but to go even so far as to propose seriously a new
      rendering of the Lord's Prayer. His famous proposal for a new version of
      the Bible, however, which Matthew Arnold solemnly held up to reprobation,
      was only a joke which Matthew Arnold did not see&mdash;the new version of
      Job being, in fact, a clever bit of political satire against party
      leadership in England. Even more brilliant examples of his skill in
      political satire are his imaginary <i>Edict of the King of Prussia against
      England</i>, and his famous <i>Rules for Reducing a Great Empire to a
      Small One</i>. But I must not try to call the roll of all the good things
      in Franklin's ten volumes. I will simply say that those who know Franklin
      only in his <i>Autobiography</i>, charming as that classic production is,
      have made but an imperfect acquaintance with <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span> the range, the vitality, the
      vigor of this admirable craftsman who chose a style "smooth, clear, and
      short," and made it serve every purpose of his versatile and beneficent
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the passage of the Stamp Act in 1765 startled the American colonies
      out of their provincial sense of security and made them aware of their
      real attitude toward the mother country, Franklin was in London. Eleven
      years earlier, in 1754, he had offered a plan for the <i>Union of the
      Colonies</i>, but this had not contemplated separation from England. It
      was rather what we should call a scheme for imperial federation under the
      British Crown. We may use his word union, however, in a different field
      from that of politics. How much union of sentiment, of mental and moral
      life, of literary, educational, and scientific endeavor, was there in the
      colonies when the hour of self-examination came? Only the briefest summary
      may be attempted here.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to race, these men of the third and fourth generation since the
      planting of the colonies were by no means so purely English as the first
      settlers. The 1,600,000 colonists in 1760 were mingled of many stocks, the
      largest non-English elements being German and Scotch-Irish&mdash;that is,
      Scotch <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
      who had settled for a while in Ulster before emigrating to America. "About
      one-third of the colonists in 1760," says Professor Channing, "were born
      outside of America." Cr&egrave;vec&oelig;ur's <i>Letters from an American
      Farmer</i> thus defined the Americans: "They are a mixture of English,
      Scotch, Irish, French, Dutch, Germans, and Swedes. From this promiscuous
      breed that race now called Americans has arisen." The Atlantic seaboard,
      with a narrow strip inland, was fairly well covered by local communities,
      differing in blood, in religion, in political organization&mdash;a
      congeries of separate experiments or young utopias, waiting for that most
      utopian experiment of all, a federal union. But the dominant language of
      the "promiscuous breed" was English, and in the few real centers of
      intellectual life the English tradition was almost absolute.
    </p>
    <p>
      The merest glance at colonial journalism will confirm this estimate. The
      <i>Boston News-Letter</i>, begun in 1704, was the first of the journals,
      if we omit the single issue of <i>Publick Occurrences</i> in the same town
      in 1690. By 1765 there were nearly fifty colonial newspapers and several
      magazines. Their influence made for union, in Franklin's sense of that
      word, and their literary models, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61"
      id="Page_61">61</a></span> like their paper, type, and even ink, were
      found in London. The <i>New England Courant</i>, established in Boston in
      1721 by James Franklin, is full of imitations of the <i>Tatler</i>, <i>Spectator</i>,
      and <i>Guardian</i>. What is more, the <i>Courant</i> boasted of its
      office collection of books, including Shakespeare, Milton, the <i>Spectator</i>,
      and Swift's <i>Tale of a Tub</i>. &sup1; This was in 1722. If we remember
      that no allusion to Shakespeare has been discovered in the colonial
      literature of the seventeenth century, and scarcely an allusion to the
      Puritan poet Milton, and that the Harvard College Library in 1723 had
      nothing of Addison, Steele, Bolingbroke, Dryden, Pope, and Swift, and had
      only recently obtained copies of Milton and Shakespeare, we can appreciate
      the value of James Franklin's apprenticeship in London. Perhaps we can
      even forgive him for that attack upon the Mathers which threw the conduct
      of the <i>Courant</i>, for a brief period, into the hands of his brother
      Benjamin, whose turn at a London apprenticeship was soon to come.

    </div>
    <p>
      If we follow this younger brother to Philadelphia and to Bradford's <i>American
      Mercury</i> or <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
      to Franklin's own <i>Pennsylvania Gazette</i>, or if we study the <i>Gazettes</i>
      of Maryland, Virginia, and South Carolina, the impression is still the
      same. The literary news is still chiefly from London, from two months to a
      year late. London books are imported and reprinted. Franklin reprints <i>Pamela</i>,
      and his Library Company of Philadelphia has two copies of <i>Paradise Lost</i>
      for circulation in 1741, whereas there had been no copy of that work in
      the great library of Cotton Mather. American journalism then, as now, owed
      its vitality to a secular spirit of curiosity about the actual world. It
      followed England as its model, but it was beginning to develop a temper of
      its own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonial education and colonial science were likewise chiefly indebted to
      London, but by 1751 Franklin's papers on electricity began to repay the
      loan. A university club in New York in 1745 could have had but fifteen
      members at most, for these were all the "academics" in town. Yet Harvard
      had then been sending forth her graduates for more than a century. William
      and Mary was founded in 1693, Yale in 1701, Princeton in 1746, King's (now
      Columbia) in 1754, the University of Pennsylvania in 1755, and Brown in
      1764. These colonial colleges were mainly <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span> in the hands of clergymen. They
      tended to reproduce a type of scholarship based upon the ancient
      languages. The curriculum varied but little in the different colonies, and
      this fact helped to produce a feeling of fellowship among all members of
      the republic of letters. The men who debated the Stamp Act were, with a
      few striking exceptions, men trained in Latin and Greek, familiar with the
      great outlines of human history, accustomed to the discipline of academic
      disputation. They knew the ideas and the vocabulary of cultivated Europe
      and were conscious of no provincial inferiority. In the study of the
      physical sciences, likewise, the colonials were but little behind the
      mother country. The Royal Society had its distinguished members here. The
      Mathers, the Dudleys, John Winthrop of Connecticut, John Bartram, James
      Logan, James Godfrey, Cadwallader Colden, and above all, Franklin himself,
      were winning the respect of European students, and were teaching Americans
      to use their eyes and their minds not merely upon the records of the past
      but in searching out the inexhaustible meanings of the present. There is
      no more fascinating story than that of the beginnings of American science
      in and outside of the colleges, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64"
      id="Page_64">64</a></span> and this movement, like the influence of
      journalism and of the higher education, counted for colonial union.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor Tyler, our foremost literary student of the period, summarizes
      the characteristics of colonial literature in these words: "Before the
      year 1765, we find in this country, not one American people, but many
      American peoples.&hellip; No cohesive principle prevailed, no centralizing
      life; each little nation was working out its own destiny in its own
      fashion." But he adds that with that year the colonial isolation came to
      an end, and that the student must thereafter "deal with the literature of
      one multitudinous people, variegated, indeed, in personal traits, but
      single in its commanding ideas and in its national destinies." It is easy
      to be wise after the event. Yet there was living in London in 1765, as the
      agent for Pennsylvania, a shrewd and bland Colonial&mdash;an honorary M.A.
      from both Harvard and Yale, a D.C.L. of Oxford and an LL.D. of St. Andrews&mdash;who
      was by no means sure that the Stamp Act meant the end of Colonialism. And
      Franklin's uncertainty was shared by Washington. When the tall Virginian
      took command of the Continental Army as late as 1775, he "abhorred the
      idea <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span> of
      independence." Nevertheless John Jay, writing the second number of the <i>Federalist</i>
      in 1787, only twelve years later, could say: "Providence has been pleased
      to give this one connected country to one united people; a people
      descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language, professing
      the same religion, attached to the same principles of government."

      <span class="smcap">If</span> we turn, however, to the literature produced
      in America between the passage of the Stamp Act in 1765 and the adoption
      of the Constitution in 1787, we perceive that it is a literature of
      discord and passion. Its spirit is not that of "one united people."
      Washington could indeed declare in his <i>Farewell Address</i> of 1796,
      "With slight shades of difference, you have the same religion, manners,
      habits, and political principles"; yet no one knew better than Washington
      upon what a slender thread this political unity had often hung, and how
      impossible it had been to foresee the end from the beginning.

      It is idle to look in the writings of the Revolutionary period for the
      literature of beauty, for a quiet harmonious unfolding of the deeper
      secrets of life. It was a time of swift and pitiless change, of action
      rather than reflection, of the turning <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span> of many separate currents into
      one headlong stream. "We must, indeed, all hang together," runs Franklin's
      well-known witticism in Independence Hall, "or, most assuredly, we shall
      all hang separately." Excellently spoken, Doctor! And that homely, cheery,
      daring sentence gives the keynote of much of the Revolutionary writing
      that has survived. It may be heard in the state papers of Samuel Adams,
      the oratory of Patrick Henry, the pamphlets of Thomas Paine, the satires
      of Freneau and Trumbull, and in the subtle, insinuating, thrilling
      paragraphs of Thomas Jefferson.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can only glance in passing at the literature of the Lost Cause, the
      Loyalist or "Tory" pleadings for allegiance to Britain. It was written by
      able and honest men, like Boucher and Odell, Seabury, Leonard and
      Galloway. They distrusted what Seabury called "our sovereign Lord the
      Mob." They represented, in John Adams's opinion, nearly one-third of the
      people of the colonies, and recent students believe that this estimate was
      too low. In some colonies the Loyalists were clearly in the majority. In
      all they were a menacing element, made up of the conservative, the
      prosperous, the well-educated, with a mixture, of course, of mere placemen
      and tuft-hunters. They <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
      composed weighty pamphlets, eloquent sermons, and sparkling satire in
      praise of the old order of things. When their cause was lost forever, they
      wrote gossipy letters from their exile in London or pathetic verses in
      their new home in Nova Scotia and Ontario. Their place in our national
      life and literature has never been filled, and their talents and virtues
      are never likely to receive adequate recognition. They took the wrong fork
      of the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were gentle spirits, too, in this period, endowed with delicate
      literary gifts, but quite unsuited for the clash of controversy&mdash;members,
      in Cr&egrave;vec&oelig;ur's touching words, of the "secret communion among
      good men throughout the world." "I am a lover of peace, what must I do?"
      asks Cr&egrave;vec&oelig;ur in his <i>Letters from an American Farmer</i>.
      "I was happy before this unfortunate Revolution. I feel that I am no
      longer so, therefore I regret the change. My heart sometimes seems tired
      with beating, it wants rest like my eyelids, which feel oppressed with so
      many watchings." Cr&egrave;vec&oelig;ur, an immigrant from Normandy, was
      certainly no weakling, but he felt that the great idyllic American
      adventure&mdash;which he described so captivatingly in his chapter
      entitled <i>What is an American</i>&mdash;was <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span> ending tragically in civil war.
      Another white-souled itinerant of that day was John Woolman of New Jersey,
      whose <i>Journal</i>, praised by Charles Lamb and Channing and edited by
      Whittier, is finding more readers in the twentieth century than it won in
      the nineteenth. "A man unlettered," said Whittier, "but with natural
      refinement and delicate sense of fitness, the purity of whose heart enters
      into his language." Woolman died at fifty-two in far-away York, England,
      whither he had gone to attend a meeting of the Society of Friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three tall volumes of the Princeton edition of the poems of Philip
      Freneau bear the sub-title, "Poet of the American Revolution." But our
      Revolution, in truth, never had an adequate poet. The prose-men, such as
      Jefferson, rose nearer the height of the great argument than did the men
      of rhyme. Here and there the struggle inspired a brisk ballad like Francis
      Hopkinson's <i>Battle of the Kegs</i>, a Hudibrastic satire like
      Trumbull's <i>McFingal</i>, or a patriotic song like Timothy Dwight's <i>Columbia</i>.
      Freneau painted from his own experience the horrors of the British
      prison-ship, and celebrated, in cadences learned from Gray and Collins,
      the valor of the men who fell at Eutaw <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span> Springs. There was patriotic
      verse in extraordinary profusion, but its literary value is slight, and it
      reveals few moods of the American mind that are not more perfectly
      conveyed through oratory, the pamphlet, and the political essay. The
      immediate models of this Revolutionary verse were the minor British bards
      of the eighteenth century, a century greatly given to verse-writing, but
      endowed by Heaven with the "prose-reason" mainly. The reader of Burton E.
      Stevenson's collection of <i>Poems of American History</i> can easily
      compare the contemporary verse inspired by the events of the Revolution
      with the modern verse upon the same historic themes. He will see how
      slenderly equipped for song were most of the later eighteenth-century
      Americans and how unfavorable to poetry was the tone of that hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Freneau himself suffered, throughout his long career, from the depressing
      indifference of his public to the true spirit of poetry. "An old college
      mate of mine," said James Madison&mdash;who was by tradition Freneau's
      room-mate at Princeton in the class of 1771&mdash;"a poet and man of
      literary and refined tastes, knowing nothing of the world." When but three
      years out of college, the cautious Madison wrote to another friend: <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span> "Poetry wit
      and Criticism Romances Plays &amp;c captivated me much: but I begin to
      discover that they deserve but a moderate portion of a mortal's Time and
      that something more substantial more durable more profitable befits our
      riper age." Madison was then at the ripe age of twenty-three! Professor
      Pattee, Freneau's editor, quotes these words to illustrate the "common
      sense" atmosphere of the age which proved fatal to Freneau's development.
      Yet the sturdy young New Yorker, of Huguenot descent, is a charming
      figure, and his later malevolence was shown only to his political foes.
      After leaving Princeton he tries teaching, the law, the newspaper, the
      sea; he is aflame with patriotic zeal; he writes, like most American
      poets, far too much for his own reputation. As the editor of the <i>National
      Gazette</i> in Philadelphia, he becomes involved in the bitter quarrel
      between his chief, Jefferson, and Alexander Hamilton. His attachment to
      the cause of the French Revolution makes him publish baseless attacks upon
      Washington. By and by he retires to a New Jersey farm, still toying with
      journalism, still composing verses. He turns patriotic poet once more in
      the War of 1812; but the public has now forgotten him. <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span> He lives on
      in poverty and seclusion, and in his eightieth year loses his way in a
      snowstorm and perishes miserably&mdash;this in 1832, the year of the death
      of the great Sir Walter Scott, who once had complimented Freneau by
      borrowing one of his best lines of poetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is in the orations and pamphlets and state papers inspired by the
      Revolutionary agitation that we find the most satisfactory expression of
      the thought and feeling of that generation. Its typical literature is
      civic rather than &aelig;sthetic, a sort of writing which has been
      incidental to the accomplishing of some political, social, or moral
      purpose, and which scarcely regards itself as literature at all. James
      Otis's argument against the Writs of Assistance in Massachusetts in 1761,
      and Patrick Henry's speech in the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1765,
      mark epochs in the emotional life of these communities. They were reported
      imperfectly or not at all, but they can no more be ignored in an
      assessment of our national experience than editorials, sermons, or
      conversations which have expressed the deepest feelings of a day and then
      have perished beyond resurrection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet if natural orators like Otis and Henry be denied a strictly "literary"
      rating because their <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
      surviving words are obviously inadequate to account for the popular effect
      of their speeches, it is still possible to measure the efficiency of the
      pamphleteer. When John Adams tells us that "James Otis was Isaiah and
      Ezekiel united," we must take his word for the impression which Otis's
      oratory left upon his mind. But John Adams's own writings fill ten stout
      volumes which invite our judgment. The "truculent and sarcastic splendor"
      of his hyperboles need not blind us to his real literary excellencies,
      such as clearness, candor, vigor of phrase, freshness of idea. A testy,
      rugged, "difficult" person was John Adams, but he grew mellower with age,
      and his latest letters and journals are full of whimsical charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Adams's cousin Samuel was not precisely a charming person. Bigoted,
      tireless, secretive, this cunning manipulator of political passions
      followed many tortuous paths. His ability for adroit misstatement of an
      adversary's position has been equaled but once in our history. But to the
      casual reader of his four volumes, Samuel Adams seems ever to be breathing
      the liberal air of the town-meeting: everything is as plainly obvious as a
      good citizen can make it. He has, too, the large utterance of the European
      liberalism of his day. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
      "Resolved," read his Resolutions of the House of Representatives of
      Massachusetts in 1765, "that there are certain essential rights of the
      British constitution of government which are founded in the law of God and
      nature and are the common rights of mankind." In his statement of the
      Rights of the Colonists (1772) we are assured that "among the natural
      rights of the colonists are these, First, a right to Life; secondly to
      Liberty; thirdly to Property.&hellip; All men have a Right to remain in a
      State of Nature as long as they please.&hellip; When Men enter into
      Society, it is by voluntary consent." Jean-Jacques himself could not be
      more bland, nor at heart more fiercely demagogic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom" Paine would have been no match for "Sam" Adams in a town-meeting,
      but he was an even greater pamphleteer. He had arrived from England in
      1774, at the age of thirty-eight, having hitherto failed in most of his
      endeavors for a livelihood. "Rebellious Staymaker; unkempt," says Carlyle;
      but General Charles Lee noted that there was "genius in his eyes," and he
      bore a letter of introduction from Franklin commending him as an
      "ingenious, worthy young man," which obtained for him a position on the <i>Pennsylvania
      Magazine</i>. Before he had been a year on American soil, Paine <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span> was writing
      the most famous pamphlet of our political literature, <i>Common Sense</i>,
      which appeared in January, 1776. "A style hitherto unknown on this side of
      the Atlantic," wrote Edmund Randolph. Yet this style of familiar talk to
      the crowd had been used seventy years earlier by Defoe and Swift, and it
      was to be employed again by a gaunt American frontiersman who was born in
      1809, the year of Thomas Paine's death. <i>The Crisis</i>, a series of
      thirteen pamphlets, of which the first was issued in December, 1776,
      seemed to justify the contemporary opinion that the "American cause owed
      as much to the pen of Paine as to the sword of Washington." Paine, who was
      now serving in the army, might have heard his own words, "These are the
      times that try men's souls," read aloud, by Washington's orders, to the
      ragged troops just before they crossed the Delaware to win the victory of
      Trenton. The best known productions of Paine's subsequent career, <i>The
      Rights of Man</i> and <i>The Age of Reason</i>, were written in Europe,
      but they were read throughout America. The reputation of the "rebellious
      Staymaker" has suffered from certain grimy habits and from the ridiculous
      charge of atheism. He was no more an atheist than Franklin or Jefferson.
      In no sense an original <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76"
      id="Page_76">76</a></span> thinker, he could impart to outworn shreds of
      deistic controversy and to shallow generalizations about democracy a
      personal fervor which transformed them and made his pages gay and bold and
      clear as a trumpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clear and bold and gay was Alexander Hamilton likewise; and his literary
      services to the Revolution are less likely to be underestimated than
      Thomas Paine's. They began with that boyish speech in "the Fields" of New
      York City in 1774 and with <i>The Farmer Refuted</i>, a reply to Samuel
      Seabury's <i>Westchester Farmer</i>. They were continued in extraordinary
      letters, written during Hamilton's military career, upon the defects of
      the Articles of Confederation and of the finances of the Confederation.
      Hamilton contributed but little to the actual structure of the new
      Constitution, but as a debater he fought magnificently and triumphantly
      for its adoption by the Convention of the State of New York in 1788.
      Together with Jay and Madison he defended the fundamental principles of
      the Federal Union in the remarkable series of papers known as the <i>Federalist</i>.
      These eighty-five papers, appearing over the signature "Publius" in two
      New York newspapers between October, 1787, and April, 1788, owed their
      conception <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
      largely to Hamilton, who wrote more than half of them himself. In manner
      they are not unlike the substantial Whig literature of England, and in
      political theory they have little in common with the Revolutionary
      literature which we have been considering. The reasoning is close, the
      style vigorous but neither warmed by passion nor colored by the individual
      emotions of the author. The <i>Federalist</i> remains a classic example of
      the civic quality of our post-Revolutionary American political writing,
      broadly social in its outlook, well informed as to the past, confident&mdash;but
      not reckless&mdash;of the future. Many Americans still read it who would
      be shocked by Tom Paine and bored with Edmund Burke. It has none of the
      literary genius of either of those writers, but its formative influence
      upon successive generations of political thinking has been steadying and
      sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, our citizen literature cannot be understood aright if one fails
      to observe that its effect has often turned, not upon mere verbal skill,
      but upon the weight of character behind the words. Thus the grave and
      reserved George Washington says of the Constitution of 1787: "Let us raise
      a standard to which the wise and the honest can <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span> repair; the event is in the hand
      of God." The whole personality of the great Virginian is back of that
      simple, perfect sentence. It brings us to our feet, like a national
      anthem.
    </p>
    <p>
      One American, no doubt our most gifted man of letters of that century,
      passed most of the Revolutionary period abroad, in the service of his
      country. Benjamin Franklin was fifty-nine in the year of the Stamp Act.
      When he returned from France in 1785 he was seventy-nine, but he was still
      writing as admirably as ever when he died at eighty-four. We cannot
      dismiss this singular, varied, and fascinating American better than by
      quoting the letter which George Washington wrote to him in September,
      1789. It has the dignity and formality of the eighteenth century, but it
      is warm with tested friendship and it glows with deep human feeling: "If
      to be venerated for benevolence, if to be admired for talents, if to be
      esteemed for patriotism, if to be beloved for philanthropy, can gratify
      the human mind, you must have the pleasing consolation to know that you
      have not lived in vain. And I flatter myself that it will not be ranked
      among the least grateful occurrences of your life to be assured, that, so
      long as I retain my memory, you will be recollected with respect,
      veneration, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
      and affection by your sincere friend, George Washington."
    </p>
    <p>
      There remains another Virginian, the symbol of the Revolutionary age, the
      author of words more widely known around the globe than any other words
      penned by an American. "Thomas Jefferson," writes the latest of his
      successors in the Presidency, "was not a man of the people, but he was a
      man of such singular insight that he saw that all the roots of generous
      power come from the people." On his father's side Jefferson came from
      sound yeoman stock, in which Welsh blood ran. His mother was a Virginia
      Randolph. Born in Albemarle County, near the "little mountain"&mdash;Monticello&mdash;where
      he built a mansion for his bride and where he lies buried, the tall,
      strong, red-haired, gray-eyed, gifted boy was reputed the best shot, the
      best rider, the best fiddle-player in the county. He studied hard at
      William and Mary over his Greek, Latin, French, Italian, and Spanish, but
      he also frequented the best society of the little capital. He learned to
      call himself a Deist and to theorize about ideal commonwealths. There was
      already in him that latent radicalism which made him strike down, as soon
      as he had the power, two of the fundamental principles of the society into
      which he <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
      was born, the principle of entailed property and that of church
      establishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the youth of twenty-two who was thrilled in 1765 by the Stamp
      Act. In the ten years of passionate discussion which followed, two things
      became clear: first, that there had long existed among the colonists very
      radical theoretical notions of political freedom; and second, that there
      was everywhere a spirit of practical conservatism. Jefferson illustrates
      the union of these two tendencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took his seat in the Continental Congress in June, 1775. He was only
      thirty-two, but he had already written, in the summer of 1774, <i>A
      Summary View of the Rights of British America</i> which had been published
      in England by Burke, himself a judge of good writing and sound politics.
      Jefferson had also prepared in 1775 the <i>Address of the Virginia House
      of Burgesses</i>. For these reasons he was placed at the head of the
      Committee for drafting the Declaration of Independence. We need not linger
      over the familiar circumstances of its composition. Everybody knows how
      Franklin and Adams made a few verbal alterations in the first draft, how
      the committee of five then reported it to the Congress, which proceeded to
      cut out <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
      about one-fourth of the matter, while Franklin tried to comfort the
      writhing author with his cheerful story about the sign of John Thompson
      the hatter. Forty-seven years afterwards, in reply to the charge of lack
      of originality brought against the Declaration by Timothy Pickering and
      John Adams&mdash;charges which have been repeated at intervals ever since&mdash;Jefferson
      replied philosophically: "Whether I gathered my ideas from reading or
      reflection I do not know. I know only that I turned neither to book nor
      pamphlet while writing it. I did not consider it as any part of my charge
      to invent new ideas altogether and to offer no sentiment which had ever
      been expressed before." O wise young man, and fundamentally Anglo-Saxon
      young man, to turn his back, in that crisis, to the devil of mere
      cleverness, and stick to recognized facts and accepted sentiments! But his
      pen retains its cunning in spite of him; and the drop of hot Welsh blood
      tells; and the cosmopolitan reading and thinking tell; and they transform
      what Pickering called a "commonplace compilation, its sentiments hackneyed
      in Congress for two years before," into an immortal manifesto to mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its method is the simplest. The preamble is <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span> philosophical, dealing with
      "self-evident" truths. Today the men who dislike or doubt these truths
      dismiss the preamble as "theoretical," or, to use another term of
      derogation favored by reactionaries, "French." But if the preamble be
      French and philosophical, the specific charges against the King are very
      English and practical. Here are certain facts, presented no doubt with
      consummate rhetorical skill, but facts, undeniably. The Anglo-Saxon in
      Jefferson is basal, racial; the turn for academic philosophizing after the
      French fashion is personal, acquired; but the range and sweep and enduring
      vitality of this matchless state paper lie in its illumination of stubborn
      facts by general principles, its decent respect to the opinions of
      mankind, its stately and noble utterance of national sentiments and
      national reasons to a "candid world."
    </p>
    <p>
      It has long been the fashion, among a certain school of half-hearted
      Americans&mdash;and unless I am mistaken, the teaching has increased
      during the last decades&mdash;to minimize the value of Jefferson's
      "self-evident truths." Rufus Choate, himself a consummate rhetorician,
      sneered at those "glittering generalities," and countless college-bred
      men, some of them occupying the highest <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span> positions, have echoed the
      sneer. The essence of the objection to Jefferson's platform lies of course
      in his phrase, "all men are created equal," with the subsidiary phrase
      about governments "deriving their just powers from the consent of the
      governed." Editors and congressmen and even college professors have
      proclaimed themselves unable to assent to these phrases of the
      Declaration, and unable even to understand them. These objectors belong
      partly, I think, in Jefferson's category of "nervous persons"&mdash;"anti-republicans,"
      as he goes on to define them&mdash;"whose languid fibres have more analogy
      with a passive than an active state of things." Other objectors to the
      phrase "all men are created equal" have had an obvious personal or
      political motive for refusing assent to the proposition. But "no
      intelligent man," says one of Jefferson's biographers, "has ever
      misconstrued it [the Declaration] except intentionally."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody would claim today that Thomas Jefferson's statement of the
      sentiments and reasons for the independence of the thirteen British
      colonies in 1776 was an adequate handbook of political wisdom, fit for all
      the exigencies of contemporary American democracy. It is not that. It is
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span> simply,
      in Lincoln's phrase, one of "the standard maxims of free society" which no
      democracy can safely disregard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jefferson's long life, so varied, so flexible, so responsive to the touch
      of popular forces, illustrates the process by which the Virginia mind of
      1743 became the nationalized, unionized mind of 1826. It is needless here
      to dwell upon the traits of his personal character: his sweetness of
      spirit, his stout-heartedness in disaster, his scorn of money, his love
      for the intellectual life. "I have no ambition to govern men," he wrote to
      Edward Rutledge. He was far happier talking about Greek and Anglo-Saxon
      with Daniel Webster before the fire-place of Monticello than he ever was
      in the presidential chair. His correspondence was enormous. His writings
      fill twenty volumes. In his theories of education he was fifty years ahead
      of his time; in his absolute trust in humanity he was generations ahead of
      it. "I am not one of those who fear the people," he declared proudly. It
      is because of this touching faith, this invincible and matchless ardor,
      that Jefferson is today remembered. He foreshadowed Lincoln. His belief in
      the inarticulate common people is rewarded by their obstinate fidelity to
      his name as a type and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
      symbol. "I know of no safe depository of the ultimate powers of society
      but the people themselves," wrote Jefferson, and with the people
      themselves is the depository of his fame.

      The Knickerbocker Group

    <p class="noindent">
      <span class="smcap">The</span> Fourth of July orator for 1826 in
      Cambridge, Massachusetts, was Edward Everett. Although only thirty-two he
      was already a distinguished speaker. In the course of his oration he
      apostrophized John Adams and Thomas Jefferson as venerable survivors of
      that momentous day, fifty years earlier, which had witnessed our
      Declaration of Independence. But even as Everett was speaking, the aged
      author of the Declaration breathed his last at Monticello, and in the
      afternoon of that same day Adams died also, murmuring, it is said, with
      his latest breath, and as if with the whimsical obstinacy of an old man
      who hated to be beaten by his ancient rival, "Thomas Jefferson still
      lives." But Jefferson was already gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the first of August, Everett commemorated the career of the two
      Revolutionary leaders, and on the following day a greater than Everett,
      Daniel <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
      Webster, pronounced the famous eulogy in Faneuil Hall. Never were the
      thoughts and emotions of a whole country more adequately voiced than in
      this commemorative oratory. Its pulse was high with national pride over
      the accomplishments of half a century. "I ask," Everett declared, "whether
      more has not been done to extend the domain of civilization, in fifty
      years, since the Declaration of Independence, than would have been done in
      five centuries of continued colonial subjection?" Webster asserted in his
      peroration: "It cannot be denied, but by those who would dispute against
      the sun, that with America, and in America, a new era commences in human
      affairs. This era is distinguished by free representative governments, by
      entire religious liberty, by improved systems of national intercourse, by
      a newly awakened and an unconquerable spirit of free enquiry, and by a
      diffusion of knowledge through the community such as has been before
      altogether unknown and unheard of."
    </p>
    <p>
      Was this merely the "tall talk" then so characteristic of American oratory
      and soon to be satirized in <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>? Or was it prompted
      by a deep and true instinct for the significance of the vast changes that
      had come over American life <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88"
      id="Page_88">88</a></span> since 1776? The external changes were familiar
      enough to Webster's auditors: the opening of seemingly illimitable
      territory through the Louisiana Purchase, the development of roads,
      canals, and manufactures; a rapid increase in wealth and population; a
      shifting of political power due to the rise of the new West&mdash;in a
      word, the evidences of irrepressible national energy. But this energy was
      inadequately expressed by the national literature. The more cultivated
      Americans were quite aware of this deficiency. It was confessed by the
      pessimistic Fisher Ames and by the ardent young men who in 1815 founded <i>The
      North American Review</i>. British critics in <i>The Edinburgh</i> and <i>The
      Quarterly</i>, commenting upon recent works of travel in America, pointed
      out the literary poverty of the American soil. Sydney Smith, by no means
      the most offensive of these critics, declared in 1820: "During the thirty
      or forty years of their independence they have done absolutely nothing for
      the sciences, for the arts, for literature.&hellip; In the four quarters
      of the globe, who reads an American book? or goes to an American play? or
      looks at an American picture or statue?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sydney Smith's question "Who reads an American book?" has outlived all of
      his own clever <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
      volumes. Even while he was asking it, London was eagerly reading Irving's
      <i>Sketch Book</i>. In 1821 came Fenimore Cooper's <i>Spy</i> and Bryant's
      <i>Poems</i>, and by 1826, when Webster was announcing in his rolling
      orotund that Adams and Jefferson were no more, the London and Paris
      booksellers were covering their stalls with Cooper's <i>The Last of the
      Mohicans</i>. Irving, Cooper, and Bryant are thus the pioneers in a new
      phase of American literary activity, often called, for convenience in
      labeling, the Knickerbocker Group because of the identification of these
      men with New York. And close behind these leaders come a younger company,
      destined likewise, in the shy boyish words of Hawthorne, one of the
      number, "to write books that would be read in England." For by 1826
      Hawthorne and Longfellow were out of college and were trying to learn to
      write. Ticknor, Prescott, and Bancroft, somewhat older men, were settling
      to their great tasks. Emerson was entering upon his duties as a minister.
      Edgar Allan Poe, at that University of Virginia which Jefferson had just
      founded, was doubtless revising <i>Tamerlane and Other Poems</i> which he
      was to publish in Boston in the following year. Holmes was a Harvard
      undergraduate. Garrison had just printed <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span> Whittier's first published poem
      in the Newburyport <i>Free Press</i>. Walt Whitman was a barefooted boy on
      Long Island, and Lowell, likewise seven years of age, was watching the
      birds in the tree-tops of Elmwood. But it was Washington Irving who showed
      all of these men that nineteenth century England would be interested in
      American books.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very word Knickerbocker is one evidence of the vitality of Irving's
      happy imaginings. In 1809 he had invented a mythical Dutch historian of
      New York named Diedrich Knickerbocker and fathered upon him a witty parody
      of Dr. Mitchill's grave <i>Picture of New York</i>. To read Irving's
      chapters today is to witness one of the rarest and most agreeable of
      phenomena, namely, the actual beginning of a legend which the world is
      unwilling to let die. The book made Sir Walter Scott's sides ache with
      laughter, and reminded him of the humor of Swift and Sterne. But certain
      New Yorkers were slow to see the joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irving was himself a New Yorker, born just at the close of the Revolution,
      of a Scotch father and English mother. His youth was pleasantly idle, with
      a little random education, much theater-going, and plentiful rambles with
      a gun along the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
      Hudson River. In 1804 he went abroad for his health, returned and helped
      to write the light social satire of the <i>Salmagundi Papers</i>, and
      became, after the publication of the <i>Knickerbocker History</i>, a local
      celebrity. Sailing for England in 1815 on business, he stayed until 1832
      as a roving man of letters in England and Spain and then as Secretary of
      the American Legation in London. <i>The Sketch Book</i>, <i>Bracebridge
      Hall</i>, and <i>Tales of a Traveler</i> are the best known productions of
      Irving's fruitful residence in England. The <i>Life of Columbus</i>, the
      <i>Conquest of Granada</i>, and <i>The Alhambra</i> represent his first
      sojourn in Spain. After his return to America he became fascinated with
      the Great West, made the travels described in his <i>Tour of the Prairies</i>,
      and told the story of roving trappers and the fur trade in <i>Captain
      Bonneville</i> and <i>Astoria</i>. For four years he returned to Spain as
      American Minister. In his last tranquil years at Sunnyside on the Hudson,
      where he died in 1859, he wrote graceful lives of Goldsmith and of
      Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a glance at the shelf containing Irving's books suggests but little
      of that personal quality to which he owes his significance as an
      interpreter of America to the Old World. This son of a narrow, hard,
      Scotch dealer in cutlery, this drifter <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span> about town when New York was
      only a big slovenly village, this light-hearted scribbler of satire and
      sentiment, was a gentleman born. His boyhood and youth were passed in that
      period of Post-Revolutionary reaction which exhibits the United States in
      some of its most unlovely aspects. Historians like Henry Adams and
      McMaster have painted in detail the low estate of education, religion, and
      art as the new century began. The bitter feeling of the nascent nation
      toward Great Britain was intensified by the War of 1812. The Napoleonic
      Wars had threatened to break the last threads of our friendship for
      France, and suspicion of the Holy Alliance led to an era of national
      self-assertion of which the Monroe Doctrine was only one expression. The
      raw Jacksonism of the West seemed to be gaining upon the older
      civilizations represented by Virginia and Massachusetts. The self-made
      type of man began to pose as the genuine American. And at this moment came
      forward a man of natural lucidity and serenity of mind, of perfect poise
      and good temper, who knew both Europe and America and felt that they ought
      to know one another better and to like one another more. That was Irving's
      service as an international mediator. He diffused sweetness and <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span> light in an
      era marked by bitterness and obscuration. It was a triumph of character as
      well as of literary skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the skill was very noticeable also. Irving's prose is not that of the
      Defoe-Swift-Franklin-Paine type of plain talk to the crowd. It is rather
      an inheritance from that other eighteenth century tradition, the
      conversation of the select circle. Its accents were heard in Steele and
      Addison and were continued in Goldsmith, Sterne, Cowper, and Charles Lamb.
      Among Irving's successors, George William Curtis and Charles Dudley Warner
      and William Dean Howells have been masters of it likewise. It is mellow
      human talk, delicate, regardful, capable of exquisite modulation. With
      instinctive artistic taste, Irving used this old and sound style upon
      fresh American material. In <i>Rip van Winkle</i> and <i>The Legend of
      Sleepy Hollow</i> he portrayed his native valley of the Hudson, and for a
      hundred years connoisseurs of style have perceived the exquisite fitness
      of the language to the images and ideas which Irving desired to convey. To
      render the Far West of that epoch this style is perhaps not "big" and
      broad enough, but when used as Irving uses it in describing Stratford and
      Westminster Abbey and an Old English <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span> Christmas, it becomes again a
      perfect medium. Hawthorne adopted it for <i>Our Old Home</i>, and
      Englishmen recognized it at once as a part of their own inheritance,
      enriched, like certain wines, by the voyage across the Atlantic and home
      again. Irving wrote of England, Mr. Warner once said, as Englishmen would
      have liked to write about it. When he described the Alhambra and Granada
      and the Moors, it was the style, rich both in physical sensation and in
      dreamlike reverie, which revealed to the world the quick American
      appreciation of foreign scenes and characters. Its key is sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irving's popularity has endured in England. It suffered during the middle
      of the century in his own country, for the strongest New England authors
      taught the public to demand more thought and passion than were in Irving's
      nature. Possibly the nervous, journalistic style of the twentieth century
      allows too scanty leisure of mind for the full enjoyment of the
      Knickerbocker flavor. Yet such changes as these in literary fashion
      scarcely affect the permanent service of Irving to our literature. He
      immortalized a local type&mdash;the New York Dutchman&mdash;and local
      legends, like that of Rip van Winkle; he used the framework of the <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span> narrative
      essay to create something almost like the perfected short story of Poe and
      Hawthorne; he wrote prose with unfailing charm in an age when charm was
      lacking; and, if he had no message, it should be remembered that some of
      the most useful ambassadors have had none save to reveal, with delicacy
      and tact and humorous kindness, the truth that foreign persons have
      feelings precisely like our own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Readers of Sir Walter Scott's <i>Journal</i> may remember his account of
      an evening party in Paris in 1826 where he met Fenimore Cooper, then in
      the height of his European reputation. "So the Scotch and American lions
      took the field together," wrote Sir Walter, who loved to be generous. <i>The
      Last of the Mohicans</i>, then just published, threatened to eclipse the
      fame of <i>Ivanhoe</i>. Cooper, born in 1789, was eighteen years younger
      than the Wizard of the North, and was more deeply indebted to him than he
      knew. For it was Scott who had created the immense nineteenth century
      audience for prose fiction, and who had evolved a kind of formula for the
      novel, ready for Cooper's use. Both men were natural story-tellers. Scott
      had the richer mind and the more fully developed historical imagination.
      Both were out-of-doors <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
      men, lovers of manly adventure and of natural beauty. But the American had
      the good fortune to be able to utilize in his books his personal
      experiences of forest and sea and to reveal to Europe the real romance of
      the American wilderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Cooper was the first to perceive the artistic possibilities of this
      romance, no one would claim. Brockden Brown, a Quaker youth of
      Philadelphia, a disciple of the English Godwin, had tried his hand at the
      very end of the eighteenth century upon American variations of the Gothic
      romance then popular in England. Brown had a keen eye for the values of
      the American landscape and even of the American Indian. He had a knack for
      passages of ghastly power, as his descriptions of maniacs, murderers,
      sleep-walkers, and solitaries abundantly prove. But he had read too much
      and lived too little to rival the masters of the art of fiction. And there
      was a traveled Frenchman, Chateaubriand, surely an expert in the art of
      eloquent prose, who had transferred to the pages of his American Indian
      stories, <i>Atala</i> and <i>Ren&eacute;</i>, the mystery and enchantment
      of our dark forests and endless rivers. But Chateaubriand, like Brockden
      Brown, is feverish. A taint <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97"
      id="Page_97">97</a></span> of old-world eroticism and despair hovers like
      a miasma over his magnificent panorama of the wilderness. Cooper, like
      Scott, is masculine.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a Knickerbocker only by adoption. Born in New Jersey, his childhood
      was spent in the then remote settlement of Cooperstown in Central New
      York. He had a little schooling at Albany, and a brief and inglorious
      career at Yale with the class of 1806. He went to sea for two years, and
      then served for three years in the United States Navy upon Lakes Ontario
      and Champlain, the very scene of some of his best stories. In 1811 he
      married, resigned from the Navy, and settled upon a little estate in
      Westchester County, near New York. Until the age of thirty, he was not in
      the least a bookman, but a healthy man of action. Then, as the well-known
      anecdote goes, he exclaims to his wife, after reading a stupid English
      novel, "I believe I could write a better story myself." <i>Precaution</i>
      (1820) was the result, but whether it was better than the unknown English
      book, no one can now say. It was bad enough. Yet the next year Cooper
      published <i>The Spy</i>, one of the finest of his novels, which was
      instantly welcomed in England and translated in France. Then came, in
      swift succession, <i>The Pioneers</i>, the first Leather-Stocking <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span> tale in order
      of composition, and <i>The Pilot</i>, to show that Scott's <i>Pirate</i>
      was written by a landsman! <i>Lionel Lincoln</i> and <i>The Last of the
      Mohicans</i> followed. The next seven years were spent in Europe, mainly
      in France, where <i>The Prairie</i> and <i>The Red Rover</i> were written.
      Cooper now looked back upon his countrymen with eyes of critical
      detachment, and made ready to tell them some of their faults. He came home
      to Cooperstown in 1833, the year after Irving's return to America. He had
      won, deservedly, a great fame, which he proceeded to imperil by his
      combativeness with his neighbors and his harsh strictures upon the
      national character, due mainly to his lofty conception of the ideal
      America. He continued to spin yarns of sea and shore, and to write naval
      history. The tide of fashion set against him in the eighteen-forties when
      Bulwer and Dickens rode into favor, but the stout-hearted old pioneer
      could afford to bide his time. He died in 1851, just as Mrs. Stowe was
      writing <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Two generations have passed since then, and Cooper's place in our
      literature remains secure. To have written our first historical novel, <i>The
      Spy</i>, our first sea-story, <i>The Pilot,</i> and to have created <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span> the
      Leather-Stocking series, is glory enough. In his perception of masculine
      character, Cooper ranks with Fielding. His sailors, his scouts and spies,
      his good and bad Indians, are as veritable human figures as Squire
      Western. Long Tom Coffin, Harvey Birch, Hawk-Eye, and Chingachgook are
      physically and morally true to life itself. Read the Leather-Stocking
      books in the order of the events described, beginning with <i>The
      Deerslayer</i>, then <i>The Last of the Mohicans</i>, <i>The Pathfinder</i>,
      <i>The Pioneers</i>, and ending with the vast darkening horizon of <i>The
      Prairie</i> and the death of the trapper, and one will feel how natural
      and inevitable are the fates of the personages and the alterations in the
      life of the frontier. These books vary in their poetic quality and in the
      degree of their realism, but to watch the evolution of the leading figure
      is to see human life in its actual texture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clever persons and pedantic persons have united to find fault with certain
      elements of Cooper's art. Mark Twain, in one of his least inspired
      moments, selected Cooper's novels for attack. Every grammar school teacher
      is ready to point out that his style is often prolix and his sentences are
      sometimes ungrammatical. Amateurs even criticize Cooper's seamanship,
      although it seemed <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
      impeccable to Admiral Mahan. No doubt one must admit the "helplessness,
      propriety, and incapacity" of most of Cooper's women, and the dreadfulness
      of his bores, particularly the Scotchmen, the doctors, and the
      naturalists. Like Sir Walter, Cooper seems to have taken but little pains
      in the deliberate planning of his plots. Frequently he accepts a
      ready-made formula of villain and hero, predicament and escape, renewed
      crisis and rescue, mystification and explanation, worthy of a third-rate
      novelist. His salvation lies in his genius for action, the beauty and
      grandeur of his landscapes, the primitive veracity of his children of
      nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cooper was an elemental man, and he comprehended, by means of something
      deeper than mere artistic instinct, the feelings of elemental humanity in
      the presence of the wide ocean or of the deep woods. He is as healthy and
      sane as Fielding, and he possesses an additional quality which all of the
      purely English novelists lack. It was the result of his youthful sojourn
      in the wilderness. Let us call it the survival in him of an aboriginal
      imagination. Cooper reminds one somehow of a moose&mdash;an ungraceful
      creature perhaps, but indubitably big, as many a hunter has suddenly <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span> realized
      when he has come unexpectedly upon a moose that whirled to face him in the
      twilight silence of a northern wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something of this far-off and gigantic primitivism inheres also in the
      poetry of William Cullen Bryant. His portrait, with the sweeping white
      beard and the dark folds of the cloak, suggests the Bard as the Druids
      might have known him. But in the eighteen-thirties and forties, Mr.
      Bryant's alert, clean-shaven face, and energetic gait as he strode down
      Broadway to the <i>Evening Post</i> office, suggested little more than a
      vigorous and somewhat radical editor of an increasingly prosperous
      Democratic newspaper. There was nothing of the Fringed Gentian or Yellow
      Violet about him. Like so many of the Knickerbockers, Bryant was an
      immigrant to New York; in fact, none of her adopted men of letters have
      represented so perfectly the inherited traits of the New England Puritan.
      To understand his long and honorable public life it is necessary to know
      something of the city of his choice, but to enter into the spirit of his
      poetry one must go back to the hills of western Massachusetts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryant had a right to his cold-weather mind. He came from Mayflower stock.
      His father, Dr. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
      Peter Bryant of Cummington, was a sound country physician, with liberal
      preferences in theology, Federalist views in politics, and a library of
      seven hundred volumes, rich in poetry. The poet's mother records his birth
      in her diary in terse words which have the true Spartan tang: "Nov. 3,
      1794. Stormy, wind N.&nbsp;E. Churned. Seven in the evening a son born."
      Two days later the November wind shifted. "Nov. 5, 1794. Clear, wind N.&nbsp;W.
      Made Austin a coat. Sat up all day. Went into the kitchen." The baby, it
      appears, had an abnormally large head and was dipped, day after day, in
      rude hydropathy, into an icy spring. A precocious childhood was followed
      by a stern, somewhat unhappy, but aspiring boyhood. The little fellow,
      lying prone with his brothers before the firelight of the kitchen, reading
      English poetry from his father's library, used to pray that he too might
      become a poet. At thirteen he produced a satire on Jefferson, <i>The
      Embargo</i>, which his proud Federalist father printed at Boston in 1808.
      The youth had nearly one year at Williams College, over the mountain
      ranges to the west. He wished to continue his education at Yale, but his
      father had no money for this greater venture, and the son remained at
      home. There, in the autumn of 1811, on the bleak hills, <span

      composed the first draft of <i>Thanatopsis</i>. He was seventeen, and he
      had been reading Blair's <i>Grave</i> and the poems of the consumptive
      Henry Kirke White. He hid his verses in a drawer, and five years later his
      father found them, shed tears over them, and sent them to the <i>North
      American Review</i>, where they were published in September, 1817.

    <p>
      In the meantime the young man had studied law, though with dislike of it,
      and with the confession that he sometimes read <i>The Lyrical Ballads</i>
      when he might have been reading Blackstone. One December afternoon in
      1815, he was walking from Cummington to Plainfield&mdash;aged twenty-one,
      and looking for a place in which to settle as a lawyer. Across the vivid
      sunset flew a black duck, as solitary and homeless as himself. The bird
      seemed an image of his own soul, "lone wandering but not lost." Before he
      slept that night he had composed the poem <i>To a Waterfowl</i>. No more
      authentic inspiration ever visited a poet, and though Bryant wrote verse
      for more than sixty years after that crimson sky had paled into chill
      December twilight, his lines never again vibrated with such communicative
      passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryant's ensuing career revealed the steady purpose, <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span> the stoicism, the reticence
      of the Puritan. It was highly successful, judged even by material
      standards. <i>Thanatopsis</i> had been instantly regarded in 1817 as the
      finest poem yet produced in America. The author was invited to contribute
      to the <i>North American Review</i> an essay on American poetry, and this,
      like all of Bryant's prose work, was admirably written. He delivered his
      Harvard Phi Beta Kappa poem, <i>The Ages</i>, in 1821, the year of
      Emerson's graduation. After a brief practice of the law in Great
      Barrington, he entered in 1826 into the unpromising field of journalism in
      New York. While other young Knickerbockers wasted their literary strength
      on trifles and dissipated their moral energies, Bryant held steadily to
      his daily task. His life in town was sternly ascetic, but he allowed
      himself long walks in the country, and he continued to meditate a somewhat
      thankless Muse. In 1832 he visited his brothers on the Illinois prairies,
      and stopped one day to chat with a "tall awkward uncouth lad" of racy
      conversational powers, who was leading his company of volunteers into the
      Black Hawk War. The two men were destined to meet again in 1860, when
      Bryant presided at that Cooper Union address of Lincoln's which revealed
      to New York and to the country that <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span> the former captain of
      volunteers was now a king of men. Lincoln was embarrassed on that
      occasion, it is said, by Bryant's fastidious, dignified presence. Not so
      Nathaniel Hawthorne, who had seen the poet in Rome, two years before.
      "There was a weary look in his face," wrote Hawthorne, "as if he were
      tired of seeing things and doing things.&hellip; He uttered neither
      passion nor poetry, but excellent good sense, and accurate information, on
      whatever subject transpired; a very pleasant man to associate with, but
      rather cold, I should imagine, if one should seek to touch his heart with
      one's own." Such was the impression Bryant made upon less gifted men than
      Hawthorne, as he lived out his long and useful life in the Knickerbocker
      city. Toward the close of it he was in great demand for public occasions;
      and it was after delivering a speech dedicating a statue to Mazzini in
      Central Park in 1878, when Bryant was eighty-four, that a fit of dizziness
      caused a fall which proved fatal to the venerable poet. It was just
      seventy years since Dr. Peter Bryant had published his boy's verses on <i>The
      Embargo</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Bryant's poetry has never roused any vociferous excitement, it
      has enduring qualities. The spiritual preoccupations of many a voiceless
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
      generation of New England Puritans found a tongue at last in this
      late-born son of theirs. The determining mood of his best poems, from
      boyhood to old age, was precisely that thought of transiency, "the eternal
      flow of things," which colored the imaginations of the first colonists.
      This is the central motive of <i>Thanatopsis</i>, <i>To a Waterfowl</i>,
      <i>The Rivulet</i>, <i>A Forest Hymn</i>, <i>An Evening Revery</i>, <i>The
      Crowded Street</i>, <i>The Flood of Years</i>. All of these tell the same
      story of endless change and of endless abiding, of varying eddies in the
      same mighty stream of human existence. Bryant faced the thought as calmly,
      as majestically, at seventeen as when he wrote <i>The Flood of Years</i>
      at eighty-two. He is a master of description, though he has slight gift
      for narrative or drama, and he rarely sounds the clear lyric note. But
      everywhere in his verse there is that cold purity of the winter hills in
      Western Massachusetts, something austere and elemental which reaches
      kindred spirits below the surface on which intellect and passion have
      their play, something more primitive, indeed, than human intellect or
      passion and belonging to another mode of being, something "rock-ribbed and
      ancient as the sun."

      A picture of the Knickerbocker era is not complete <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span> without its portraits of the
      minor figures in the literary life of New York up to the time of the Civil
      War. But the scope of the present volume does not permit sketches of
      Paulding and Verplanck, of Halleck and his friend Drake, of N.&nbsp;P.
      Willis and Morris and Woodworth. Some of these are today only
      "single-poem" men, like Payne, the author of <i>Home Sweet Home</i>, just
      as Key, the author of <i>The Star-Spangled Banner</i>, is today a
      "single-poem" man of an earlier generation. Their names will be found in
      such limbos of the dead as Griswold's <i>Poets and Poetry of America</i>
      and Poe's <i>Literati</i>. They knew "the town" in their day, and pleased
      its very easily pleased taste. The short-lived literary magazines of the
      eighteen-forties gave them their hour of glory. As representatives of
      passing phases of the literary history of New York their careers are not
      without sentimental interest, but few of them spoke to or for the country
      as a whole. Two figures, indeed, stand out in sharp contrast with those
      habitual strollers on Broadway and frequenters of literary gatherings,
      though each of them was for a while a part of Knickerbocker New York. To
      all appearances they were only two more Bohemians like the rest, but the
      curiosity of the twentieth <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108"
      id="Page_108">108</a></span> century sets them apart from their forgotten
      contemporaries. They are two of the unluckiest&mdash;and yet luckiest&mdash;authors
      who ever tried to sell a manuscript along Broadway. One of them is Edgar
      Allan Poe and the other is Walt Whitman. They shall have a chapter to
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before turning to that chapter, we must look back to New England once
      more and observe the blossoming-time of its ancient commonwealths. During
      the thirty years preceding the Civil War New England awoke to a new life
      of the spirit. So varied and rich was her literary productiveness in this
      era that it still remains her greatest period, and so completely did New
      England writers of this epoch voice the ideals of the nation that the
      great majority of Americans, even today, regard these New Englanders as
      the truest literary exponents of the mind and soul of the United States.
      We must take a look at them.

    <p class="chaptertitle">
      The Transcendentalists
    </p>
    <p class="noindent">
      <span class="smcap">To</span> understand the literary leadership of New
      England during the thirty years immediately preceding the Civil War it is
      necessary to recall the characteristics of a somewhat isolated and
      peculiar people. The mental and moral traits of the New England colonists,
      already glanced at in an earlier chapter, had suffered little essential
      modification in two hundred years. The original racial stock was still
      dominant. As compared with the middle and southern colonies, there was
      relatively little immigration, and this was easily assimilated. The
      physical remoteness of New England from other sections of the country, and
      the stubborn loyalty with which its inhabitants maintained their own
      standards of life, alike contributed to their sense of separateness. It is
      true, of course, that their mode of thinking and feeling had undergone
      certain changes. They were among the <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span> earliest theorists of
      political independence from Great Britain, and had done their share, and
      more, in the Revolution. The rigors of their early creed had somewhat
      relaxed, as we have seen, by the end of the seventeenth century, and
      throughout the eighteenth there was a gradual progress toward religious
      liberalism. The population steadily increased, and New England's
      unremitting struggle with a not too friendly soil, her hardihood upon the
      seas, and her keenness in trade, became proverbial throughout the country.
      Her seaport towns were wealthy. The general standards of living remained
      frugal, but extreme poverty was rare. Her people still made, as in the
      earliest days of the colonies, silent and unquestioned sacrifices for
      education, and her chief seats of learning, Harvard and Yale, remained the
      foremost educational centers of America. But there was still scant leisure
      for the quest of beauty, and slender material reward for any practitioner
      of the fine arts. Oratory alone, among the arts of expression, commanded
      popular interest and applause. Daniel Webster's audiences at Plymouth in
      1820 and at Bunker Hill in 1825 were not inferior to similar audiences of
      today in intelligence and in responsiveness. Perhaps they were superior.
      Appreciation <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
      of the spoken word was natural to men trained by generations of thoughtful
      listening to "painful" preaching and by participation in the discussions
      of town-meeting. Yet appreciation of secular literature was rare, and
      interest in the other arts was almost non-existent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, beginning in the eighteen-twenties, and developing rapidly after
      1830, came a change, a change so startling as to warrant the term of "the
      Renascence of New England." No single cause is sufficient to account for
      this "new birth." It is a good illustration of that law of "tension and
      release," which the late Professor Shaler liked to demonstrate in all
      organic life. A long period of strain was followed by an age of expansion,
      freedom, release of energy. As far as the mental life of New England was
      concerned, something of the new stimulus was due directly to the influence
      of Europe. Just as the wandering scholars from Italy had brought the New
      Learning, which was a revival of the old learning, into England in the
      sixteenth century, so now young New England college men like Edward
      Everett and George Ticknor brought home from the Continent the riches of
      German and French scholarship. Emerson's description of the impression
      made by Everett's <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
      lectures in 1820, after his return from Germany, gives a vivid picture of
      the new thirst for foreign culture. <i>The North American Review</i> and
      other periodicals, while persistently urging the need of a distinctively
      national literature, insisted also upon the value of a deeper knowledge of
      the literature of the Continent. This was the burden of Channing's once
      famous article on <i>A National Literature</i> in 1823: it was a plea for
      an independent American school of writers, but these writers should know
      the best that Europe had to teach.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purely literary movement was connected, as the great name of Channing
      suggests, with a new sense of freedom in philosophy and religion.
      Calvinism had mainly done its work in New England. It had bred an
      extraordinary type of men and women, it had helped to lay some of the
      permanent foundations of our democracy, and it was still destined to have
      a long life in the new West and in the South. But in that stern section of
      the country where its influence had been most marked there was now an
      increasingly sharp reaction against its determinism and its pessimism.
      Early in the nineteenth century the most ancient and influential churches
      in Boston and the leading professors at Harvard had accepted the new form
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span> of
      religious liberalism known as Unitarianism. The movement spread throughout
      Eastern Massachusetts and made its way to other States. Orthodox and
      liberal Congregational churches split apart, and when Channing preached
      the ordination sermon for Jared Sparks in Baltimore in 1819, the word
      Unitarian, accepted by the liberals with some misgiving, became the
      recognized motto of the new creed. It is only with its literary influence
      that we are here concerned, yet that literary influence became so potent
      that there is scarcely a New England writer of the first rank, from Bryant
      onward, who remained untouched by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most interesting and peculiar phase of the new liberalism has little
      directly to do with the specific tenets of theological Unitarianism, and
      in fact marked a revolt against the more prosaic and conventional pattern
      of English and American Unitarian thought. But this movement, known as
      Transcendentalism, would have been impossible without a preliminary and
      liberalizing stirring of the soil. It was a fascinating moment of release
      for some of the most brilliant and radical minds of New England. Its
      foremost representative in our literature was Ralph Waldo Emerson, as its
      chief <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
      exponents in England were Coleridge and Carlyle. We must understand its
      meaning if we would perceive the quality of much of the most noble and
      beautiful writing produced in New England during the Golden Age.
    </p>
    <p>
      What then is the significance of the word Transcendental? Disregarding for
      the moment the technical development of this term as used by German and
      English philosophers, it meant for Emerson and his friends simply this:
      whatever transcends or goes beyond the experience of the senses. It
      stressed intuition rather than sensation, direct perception of ultimate
      truth rather than the processes of logic. It believed in man's ability to
      apprehend the absolute ideas of Truth, Rectitude, Goodness. It resembled
      the Inner Light of the Quaker, though the Quaker traced this to a
      supernatural illumination of the Holy Spirit, while the Transcendentalist
      believed that a vision of the eternal realities was a natural endowment of
      the human mind. It had only to be trusted. Stated in this form, it is
      evident that we have here a very ancient doctrine, well known in the
      literature of India and of Greece. It has been held by countless persons
      who have never heard of the word Transcendentalism. We need <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span> go no
      further back than Alexander Pope, a Roman Catholic, whom we find
      declaring: "I am so certain of the soul's being immortal that I seem to
      feel it within me, as it were by intuition." Pope's friend Swift, a dean
      of the Church of England and assuredly no Transcendentalist, defined
      vision as seeing the things that are invisible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now turn to some of the New England men. Dr. C.&nbsp;A. Bartol, a disciple
      of Emerson, maintained that "the mistake is to make the everlasting things
      subjects of argument instead of sight." Theodore Parker declared to his
      congregation:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="noindent">
        From the primitive facts of consciousness given by the power of
        instinctive intuition, I endeavored to deduce the true notion of God, of
        justice and futurity.&hellip; I found most help in the works of Immanuel
        Kant, one of the profoundest thinkers of the world, though one of the
        worst writers, even in Germany; if he did not always furnish conclusions
        I could rest in, he yet gave me the true method, and put me on the right
        road. I found certain great primal Intuitions of Human Nature, which
        depend on no logical process of demonstration, but are rather facts of
        consciousness given by the instinctive action of human nature itself. I
        will mention only the three most important which pertain to Religion. 1.
        The Instinctive Intuition of the Divine, the consciousness that there is
        a God. 2. The Instinctive Intuition of the Just and Right, a
        consciousness that there is a Moral Law, independent <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span> of our
        will, which we ought to keep. 3. The Instinctive Intuition of the
        Immortal, a consciousness that the Essential Element of man, the
        principle of Individuality, never dies.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      This passage dates from 1859, and readers of Bergson may like to compare
      it with the contemporary Frenchman's saying: "The analytical faculties can
      give us no realities."
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us next hear Emerson himself, first in an early letter to his brother
      Edward: "Do you draw the distinction of Milton, Coleridge, and the Germans
      between Reason and Understanding? I think it a philosophy itself, and,
      like all truth, very practical. Reason is the highest faculty of the soul,
      what we mean often by the soul itself: it never reasons, never proves, it
      simply perceives, it is vision. The understanding toils all the time,
      compares, contrives, adds, argues; near-sighted, but strong-sighted,
      dwelling in the present, the expedient, the customary." And in 1833, after
      he had left the Unitarian pulpit, Emerson made in his diary this curious
      attempt to reconcile the scriptural language of his ancestral profession
      to the new vocabulary of Transcendentalism: "Jesus Christ was a minister
      of the pure Reason. The beatitudes of the Sermon on the Mount are all
      utterances of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
      mind contemning the phenomenal world.&hellip; The understanding can make
      nothing of it. 'Tis all nonsense. The Reason affirms its absolute verity.&hellip;
      St. Paul marks the distinction by the terms natural man and spiritual man.
      When Novalis says, 'It is the instinct of the Understanding to contradict
      the Reason,' he only translates into a scientific formula the doctrine of
      St. Paul, 'The Carnal Mind is enmity against God.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      One more quotation must suffice. It is from a poem by a forgotten
      Transcendentalist, F.&nbsp;G. Tuckerman.
    </p>
    <div class="poem1">
      <p class="poem1">
        No more thy meaning seek, thine anguish plead;
      </p>
      <p class="poem1">
        But, leaving straining thought and stammering word,
      </p>
      <p class="poem1">
        Across the barren azure pass to God;
      </p>
      <p class="poem1">
        Shooting the void in silence, like a bird&mdash;
      </p>
      <p class="poem1">
        A bird that shuts his wings for better speed!
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      It is obvious that this "contemning the phenomenal world," this "revulsion
      against the intellect as the sole source of truth," is highly dangerous to
      second-class minds. If one habitually prints the words Insight, Instinct,
      Intuition, Consciousness with capitals, and relegates equally useful words
      like senses, experience, fact, logic to lower-case type, one may do it
      because he is <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
      a Carlyle or an Emerson, but the chances are that he is neither.
      Transcendentalism, like all idealistic movements, had its "lunatic
      fringe," its camp-followers of excitable, unstable visionaries. The very
      name, like the name Methodist, was probably bestowed upon it in mockery,
      and this whole perturbation of staid New England had its humorous side.
      Witness the career of Bronson Alcott. It is also true that the glorious
      affirmations of these seers can be neither proved nor disproved. They made
      no examination and they sought no validation of consciousness. An explorer
      in search of the North Pole must bring back proofs of his journey, but
      when a Transcendentalist affirms that he has reached the far heights of
      human experience and even caught sight of the gods sitting on their
      thrones, you and I are obliged to take his word for it. Sometimes we hear
      such a man gladly, but it depends upon the man, not upon the
      trustworthiness of the method. Finally it should be observed that the
      Transcendental movement was an exceedingly complex one, being both
      literary, philosophic, and religious; related also to the subtle thought
      of the Orient, to medi&aelig;val mysticism, and to the English Platonists;
      touched throughout by the French Revolutionary <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span> theories, by the Romantic
      spirit, by the new zeal for science and pseudo-science, and by the unrest
      of a fermenting age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our present concern is with the impact of this cosmopolitan current upon
      the mind and character of a few New England writers. Channing and Theodore
      Parker, Margaret Fuller and Alcott, Thoreau and Emerson, are all
      representative of the best thought and the noblest ethical impulses of
      their generation. Let us choose first the greatest name: a sunward-gazing
      spirit, and, it may be, one of the very Sun-Gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pilgrim to Concord who stops for a moment in the village library to
      study French's statue of Emerson will notice the asymmetrical face. On one
      side it is the face of a keen Yankee farmer, but seen from the other side
      it is the countenance of a seer, a world's man. This contrast between the
      parochial Emerson and the greater Emerson interprets many a puzzle in his
      career. Half a mile beyond the village green to the north, close to the
      "rude bridge" of the famous Concord fight in 1775, is the Old Manse, once
      tenanted and described by Hawthorne. It was built by Emerson's
      grandfather, a patriot chaplain in the Revolution, who died of camp-fever
      at Ticonderoga. His <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
      widow married Dr. Ezra Ripley, and here Ralph Waldo Emerson and his
      brothers passed many a summer in their childhood. Half a mile east of the
      village, on the Cambridge turnpike, is Emerson's own house, still
      sheltered by the pines which Thoreau helped him to plant in 1838. Within
      the house everything is unchanged: here are the worn books, pen and
      inkstand, the favorite pictures upon the wall. Over the ridge to the north
      lies the Sleepy Hollow cemetery where the poet rests, with the gravestones
      of Hawthorne and the Alcotts, Thoreau and William James close by.
    </p>

      But although Concord is the Emerson shrine, he was born in Boston, in
      1803. His father, named William like the grandfather, was also, like the
      Emerson ancestors for many generations, a clergyman&mdash;eloquent,
      liberal, fond of books and music, highly honored by his <i>alma mater</i>
      Harvard and by the town of Boston, where he ministered to the First
      Church. His premature death in 1811 left his widow with five sons&mdash;one
      of them feebleminded&mdash;and a daughter to struggle hard with poverty.
      With her husband's sister, the Calvinistic "Aunt Mary Moody" Emerson, she
      held, however, that these orphaned boys had been <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span> "born to be educated." And
      educated the "eager blushing boys" were, at the Boston Latin School and at
      Harvard College, on a regimen of "toil and want and truth and mutual
      faith." There are many worse systems of pedagogy than this. Ralph was
      thought less persistent than his steady older brother William, and far
      less brilliant than his gifted, short-lived younger brothers, Edward and
      Charles. He had an undistinguished career at Harvard, where he was
      graduated in 1821, ranking thirtieth in a class of fifty-nine. Lovers of
      irony like to remember that he was the seventh choice of his classmates
      for the position of class poet. After some desultory teaching to help his
      brothers, he passed irregularly through the Divinity School, his studies
      often interrupted by serious ill-health. "If they had examined me," he
      said afterward of the kindly professors in the Divinity School, "they
      never would have passed me." But approve him they did, in 1826, and he
      entered decorously upon the profession of his ancestors, as associate
      minister of the Second Church in Boston. His <i>Journals</i>, which are a
      priceless record of his inner life, at this and later periods, reveal the
      rigid self-scrutiny, the tender idealism, with which he began his
      ministerial career.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span> But
      as a scheme of life for Ralph Waldo Emerson this vocation would not
      satisfy. The sexton of the Second Church thought that the young man was
      not at his best at funerals. Father Taylor, the eccentric Methodist, whom
      Emerson assisted at a sailor's Bethel near Long Wharf, considered him "one
      of the sweetest souls God ever made," but as ignorant of the principles of
      the New Testament as Balaam's ass was of Hebrew grammar. By and by came an
      open difference with his congregation over the question of administering
      the Communion. "I am not interested in it," Emerson admitted, and he wrote
      in his <i>Journal</i> the noble words: "It is my desire, in the office of
      a Christian minister, to do nothing which I cannot do with my whole
      heart." His resignation was accepted in 1832. His young wife had died of
      consumption in the same year. He now sailed for Italy, France, and
      England, a memorable journey which gave him an acquaintance with Landor,
      Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Carlyle, but which was even more significant in
      sending him, as he says, back to himself, to the resources of his own
      nature. "When shows break up," wrote Whitman afterward, "what but oneself
      is sure?" In 1834 and 1835 we find Emerson occupying a room <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span> in the Old
      Manse at Concord, strolling in the quiet fields, lecturing or preaching if
      he were invited to do so, but chiefly absorbed in a little book which he
      was beginning to write&mdash;a new utterance of a new man.
    </p>
    <p>
      This book, the now famous <i>Nature</i> of 1836, contains the essence of
      Emerson's message to his generation. It is a prose essay, but written in
      the ecstatic mood of a poet. The theme of its meditation is the soul as
      related to Nature and to God. The soul is primal; Nature, in all its
      bountiful and beautiful commodities, exists for the training of the soul;
      it is the soul's shadow. And every soul has immediate access to Deity.
      Thus the utility and beauty and discipline of Nature lift the soul
      Godward. The typical sentence of the book is this: "The sun shines today
      also"; that is to say: the world is still alive and fair; let us lift up
      our hearts! Only a few Americans of 1836 bought this singular volume, but
      Emerson went serenely forward. He had found his path.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1837 he delivered the well-known Phi Beta Kappa oration at Harvard on
      <i>The American Scholar</i>. Emerson was now thirty-four; he had married a
      second time, had bought a house of his own in Concord, and purposed to
      make a living by <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
      lecturing and writing. His address in Cambridge, though it contained no
      reference to himself, was after all a justification of the way of life he
      had chosen: a declaration of intellectual independence for himself and his
      countrymen, an exhortation of self-trust to the individual thinking man.
      "If the single man plant himself indomitably on his instincts and there
      abide, the huge world will come round to him." Such advice to cut loose
      from the moorings of the past was not unknown in Phi Beta Kappa orations,
      though it had never been so brilliantly phrased; but when Emerson applied
      precisely the same doctrine, in 1838, to the graduating class at the
      Harvard Divinity School, he roused a storm of disapproval. "A tempest in
      our washbowl," he wrote coolly to Carlyle, but it was more than that. The
      great sentence of the Divinity School address, "God is, not was; he
      speaketh, not spake," was the emphasis of a superb rhetorician upon the
      immediacy of the soul's access to God. It has been the burden of a
      thousand prophets in all religions. The young priests of the Divinity
      School, their eyes wearied with Hebrew and Greek, seem to have enjoyed
      Emerson's injunction to turn away from past records and historical
      authorities and to drink from the living fountain <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span> of the divine within
      themselves; but to the professors, "the stern old war-gods," this relative
      belittlement of historical Christianity seemed blasphemy. A generation
      passed before Emerson was again welcomed by his <i>alma mater</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader who has mastered those three utterances by the Concord
      Transcendentalist in 1836, 1837, and 1838 has the key to Emerson. He was a
      seer, not a system-maker. The constitution of his mind forbade formal,
      consecutive, logical thought. He was not a philosopher in the accepted
      sense, though he was always philosophizing, nor a metaphysician in spite
      of his curious searchings in the realm of metaphysics. He sauntered in
      books as he sauntered by Walden Pond, in quest of what interested him; he
      "fished in Montaigne," he said, as he fished in Plato and Goethe. He
      basketed the day's luck, good or bad as it might be, into the pages of his
      private <i>Journal</i>, which he called his savings-bank, because from
      this source he drew most of the material for his books. The <i>Journal</i>
      has recently been printed, in ten volumes. No American writing rewards the
      reader more richly. It must be remembered that Emerson's <i>Essays</i>,
      the first volume of which appeared in 1841, and the last volumes after his
      death in 1882, represent <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126"
      id="Page_126">126</a></span> practically three stages of composition:
      first the detached thoughts of the <i>Journal</i>; second, the
      rearrangement of this material for use upon the lecture platform; and
      finally, the essays in their present form. The oral method thus
      predominates: a series of oracular thoughts has been shaped for oratorical
      utterance, not oratorical in the bombastic, popular American sense, but
      cunningly designed, by a master of rhetoric, to capture the ear and then
      the mind of the auditor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emerson's work as a lecturer coincided with the rise of that Lyceum system
      which brought most of the American authors, for more than a generation,
      into intimate contact with the public, and which proved an important
      factor in the &aelig;sthetic and moral cultivation of our people. No
      lecturer could have had a more auspicious influence than Emerson, with his
      quiet dignity, his serene spiritual presence, his tonic and often
      electrifying force. But if he gave his audiences precious gifts, he also
      learned much from them. For thirty years his lecturing trips to the West
      brought him, more widely than any New England man of letters, into contact
      with the new, virile America of the great Mississippi valley. Unlike many
      of his friends, he was not repelled by the "Jacksonism of <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span> the West";
      he rated it a wholesome, vivifying force in our national thought and life.
      The <i>Journal</i> reveals the essential soundness of his Americanism.
      Though surrounded all his life by reformers, he was himself scarcely a
      reformer, save upon the single issue of anti-slavery. Perhaps he was at
      bottom too much of a radical to be swept off his feet by any reform.
    </p>
    <p>
      To our generation, of course, Emerson presents himself as an author of
      books, and primarily as an essayist, rather than as a winning, entrancing
      speaker. His essays have a greater variety of tone than is commonly
      recognized. Many of them, like <i>Manners</i>, <i>Farming</i>, <i>Books</i>,
      <i>Eloquence</i>, <i>Old Age</i>, exhibit a shrewd prudential wisdom, a
      sort of Yankee instinct for "the milk in the pan," that reminds one of Ben
      Franklin. Like most of the greater New England writers, he could be, on
      occasion, an admirable local historian. See his essays on <i>Life and
      Letters in New England</i>, <i>New England Reformers</i>, <i>Politics</i>,
      and the successive entries in his <i>Journal</i> relating to Daniel
      Webster. He had the happiest gift of portraiture, as is witnessed by his
      sketches of Montaigne, of Napoleon, of Socrates (in the essay on Plato),
      of his aunt Mary Moody Emerson, of Thoreau, and of various types of <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span> Englishmen
      in his <i>English Traits</i>. But the great essays, no doubt, are those
      like <i>Self-Reliance</i>, <i>Compensation</i>, <i>The Over-Soul</i>, <i>Fate</i>,
      <i>Power</i>, <i>Culture</i>, <i>Worship</i>, and <i>Illusions</i>. These
      will puzzle no one who has read carefully that first book on <i>Nature</i>.
      They all preach the gospel of intuition, instinctive trust in the
      Universe, faith in the ecstatic moment of vision into the things that are
      unseen by the physical eye. Self-reliance, as Emerson's son has pointed
      out, means really God-reliance; the Over-Soul&mdash;always a
      stumbling-block to Philistines&mdash;means that high spiritual life into
      which all men may enter and in which they share the life of Deity. Emerson
      is stern enough in expounding the laws of compensation that run through
      the universe, but to him the chief law is the law of the ever-ascending,
      victorious soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      This radiant optimism permeates his poems. By temperament a singer as well
      as a seer and sayer, Emerson was nevertheless deficient in the singing
      voice. He composed no one great poem, his verse presents no ideas that are
      not found in his prose. In metre and rhyme he is harsh and willful. Yet he
      has marvelous single phrases and cadences. He ejaculates transports and
      ecstasies, and though he cannot organize and construct in verse, he is
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
      capable here and there of the true miracle of transforming fact and
      thought into true beauty. Aldrich used to say that he would rather have
      written Emerson's <i>Bacchus</i> than any American poem.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the pure, high, and tonic mind of Emerson was universal in its survey
      of human forces, no one would claim. Certain limitations in interest and
      sympathy are obvious. "That horrid burden and impediment of the soul which
      the churches call sin," to use John Morley's words, occupied his attention
      but little. Like a mountain climber in a perilous pass, he preferred to
      look up rather than down. He does not stress particularly those old human
      words, service and sacrifice. "Anti-scientific, anti-social,
      anti-Christian" are the terms applied to him by one of his most
      penetrating critics. Yet I should prefer to say "un-scientific,"
      "un-social," and "non-Christian," in the sense in which Plato and Isaiah
      are non-Christian. Perhaps it would be still nearer the truth to say, as
      Mrs. Lincoln said of her husband, "He was not a technical Christian." He
      tends to underestimate institutions of every kind; history, except as a
      storehouse of anecdote, and culture as a steady mental discipline. This is
      the price he pays for his transcendental <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span> insistence upon the supreme
      value of the Now, the moment of insight. But after all these limitations
      are properly set down, the personality of Ralph Waldo Emerson remains a
      priceless possession to his countrymen. The austere serenity of his life,
      and the perfection with which he represents the highest type of his
      province and his era, will ultimately become blended with the thought of
      his true Americanism. A democrat and liberator, like Lincoln, he seems
      also destined like Lincoln to become increasingly a world's figure, a
      friend and guide to aspiring spirits everywhere. Differences of race and
      creed are negligible in the presence of such superb confidence in God and
      the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Citizens of Concord in May, 1862, hearing that Henry Thoreau, the
      eccentric bachelor, had just died of consumption in his mother's house on
      Main Street, in his forty-fifth year, would have smiled cannily at the
      notion that after fifty years their townsman's literary works would be
      published in a sumptuous twenty-volume edition, and that critics in his
      own country and in Europe would rank him with Ralph Waldo Emerson. Yet
      that is precisely what has happened. Our literature has no more curious
      story than the evolution of this local crank <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span> into his rightful place of
      mastership. In his lifetime he printed only two books, <i>A Week on the
      Concord and Merrimac Rivers</i>&mdash;which was even more completely
      neglected by the public than Emerson's <i>Nature</i>&mdash;and <i>Walden</i>,
      now one of the classics, but only beginning to be talked about when its
      shy, proud author penned his last line and died with the words "moose" and
      "Indian" on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thoreau, like all thinkers who reach below the surface of human life,
      means many different things to men of various temperaments. Collectors of
      human novelties, like Stevenson, rejoice in his uniqueness of flavor;
      critics, like Lowell, place him, not without impatient rigor. To some
      readers he is primarily a naturalist, an observer, of the White of
      Selborne school; to others an elemental man, a lover of the wild, a hermit
      of the woods. He has been called the poet-naturalist, to indicate that his
      powers of observation were accompanied, like Wordsworth's, by a gift of
      emotional interpretation of the meaning of phenomena. Lovers of literature
      celebrate his sheer force and penetration of phrase. But to the student of
      American thought Thoreau's prime value lies in the courage and consistency
      with which he endeavored to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132"
      id="Page_132">132</a></span> realize the gospel of Transcendentalism in
      his own inner life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lovers of racial traits like to remember that Thoreau's grandfather was an
      immigrant Frenchman from the island of Jersey, and that his grandmother
      was Scotch and Quaker. His father made lead pencils and ground plumbago in
      his own house in Concord. The mother was from New Hampshire. It was a
      high-minded family. All the four children taught school and were good
      talkers. Henry, born in 1817, was duly baptized by good Dr. Ripley of the
      Old Manse, studied Greek and Latin, and was graduated at Harvard in 1837,
      the year of Emerson's Phi Beta Kappa address. Even in college the young
      man was a trifle difficult. "Cold and unimpressible," wrote a classmate.
      "The touch of his hand was moist and indifferent. He did not care for
      people." "An unfavorable opinion has been entertained of his disposition
      to exert himself," wrote President Quincy confidentially to Emerson in
      1837, although the kindly President, a year later, in recommending Thoreau
      as a school-teacher, certified that "his rank was high as a scholar in all
      the branches and his morals and general conduct unexceptionable and
      exemplary."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten years passed. The young man gave up <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span> school-keeping, thinking it a
      loss of time. He learned pencil-making, surveying, and farm work, and
      found that by manual labor for six weeks in the year he could meet all the
      expenses of living. He haunted the woods and pastures, explored rivers and
      ponds, built the famous hut on Emerson's wood-lot with the famous axe
      borrowed from Alcott, was put in jail for refusal to pay his poll-tax,
      and, to sum up much in little, "signed off" from social obligations. "I,
      Henry D. Thoreau, have signed off, and do not hold myself responsible to
      your multifarious uncivil chaos named Civil Government." When his college
      class held its tenth reunion in 1847, and each man was asked to send to
      the secretary a record of achievement, Thoreau wrote: "My steadiest
      employment, if such it can be called, is to keep myself at the top of my
      condition and ready for whatever may turn up in heaven or on earth." There
      is the motto of Transcendentalism, stamped upon a single coin.
    </p>
    <p>
      For "to be ready for whatever may turn up" is Thoreau's racier, homelier
      version of Emerson's "endless seeker"; and Thoreau, more easily than
      Emerson, could venture to stake everything upon the quest. The elder man
      had announced the programme, but by 1847 he was himself almost <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span> what
      Thoreau would call a "committed man," with family and household
      responsibilities, with a living to earn, and bound, like every
      professional writer and speaker, to have some measure of regard for his
      public. But Thoreau was ready to travel lightly and alone. If he should
      fail in the great adventure for spiritual perfection, it was his own
      affair. He had no intimates, no confidant save the multitudinous pages of
      his <i>Journal</i>, from which&mdash;and here again he followed Emerson's
      example&mdash;his future books were to be compiled. Many of his most loyal
      admirers will admit that such a quest is bound, by the very conditions of
      the problem, to be futile. Hawthorne allegorized it in <i>Ethan Brand</i>,
      and his quaint illustration of the folly of romantic expansion of the self
      apart from the common interests of human kind is the picture of a dog
      chasing its own tail. "It is time now that I begin to live," notes Thoreau
      in the <i>Journal</i>, and he continued to say it in a hundred different
      ways until the end of all his journalizing, but he never quite captured
      the fugitive felicity. The haunting pathos of his own allegory has moved
      every reader of <i>Walden</i>: "I long ago lost a hound, a bay horse, and
      a turtle-dove, and am still on their trail." Precisely what he meant it is
      now impossible <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
      to say, but surely he betrays a doubt in the ultimate efficacy of his own
      system of life. He bends doggedly to the trail, for Henry Thoreau is no
      quitter, but the trail leads nowhere, and in the latest volumes of the <i>Journals</i>
      he seems to realize that he has been pursuing a phantom. He dived
      fearlessly and deep into himself, but somehow he failed to grasp that
      pearl of great price which all the transcendental prophets assured him was
      to be had at the cost of diving.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not to say that this austere and strenuous athlete came up quite
      empty-handed. Far from it. The by-products of his toil were enough to have
      enriched many lesser men, and they have given Thoreau a secure fame. From
      his boyhood he longed to make himself a writer, and an admirable writer he
      became. "For along time," he says in <i>Walden</i>, "I was reporter to a
      journal, of no very wide circulation, whose editor has never seen fit to
      print the bulk of my contributions, and, as is too common with writers, I
      got only my labor for my pains. However, in this case my pains were their
      reward." Like so many solitaries, he experienced the joy of intense,
      long-continued effort in composition, and he was artist enough to know
      that his pages, carefully assembled from his notebooks, <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span> had
      pungency, form, atmosphere. No man of his day, not even Lowell the "last
      of the bookmen," abandoned himself more unreservedly to the delight of
      reading. Thoreau was an accomplished scholar in the Greek and Roman
      classics, as his translations attest. He had some acquaintance with
      several modern languages, and at one time possessed the best collection of
      books on Oriental literature to be found in America. He was drenched in
      the English poetry of the seventeenth century. His critical essays in the
      <i>Dial</i>, his letters and the bookish allusions throughout his
      writings, are evidence of rich harvesting in the records of the past. He
      left some three thousand manuscript pages of notes on the American
      Indians, whose history and character had fascinated him from boyhood. Even
      his antiquarian hobbies gave him durable satisfaction. Then, too, he had
      deep delight in his life-long studies in natural history, in his
      meticulous measurements of river currents, in his notes upon the annual
      flowering of plants and the migration of birds. The more thoroughly
      trained naturalists of our own day detect him now and again in error as to
      his birds and plants, just as specialists in Maine woodcraft discover that
      he made amusing, and for him unaccountable, <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span> blunders when he climbed
      Katahdin. But if he was not impeccable as a naturalist or woodsman, who
      has ever had more fun out of his enthusiasm than Thoreau, and who has ever
      stimulated as many men and women in the happy use of their eyes? He would
      have had slight patience with much of the sentimental nature study of our
      generation, and certainly an intellectual contempt for much that we read
      and write about the call of the wild; but no reader of his books can
      escape his infection for the freedom of the woods, for the stark and
      elemental in nature. Thoreau's passion for this aspect of life may have
      been selfish, wolf-like, but it is still communicative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, toward the close of his too brief life, Thoreau "signed on" again to
      an American ideal, and no man could have signed more nobly. It was the
      cause of Freedom, as represented by John Brown of Harper's Ferry. The
      French and Scotch blood in the furtive hermit suddenly grew hot. Instead
      of renouncing in disgust the "uncivil chaos called Civil Government,"
      Thoreau challenged it to a fight. Indeed he had already thrown down the
      gauntlet in <i>Slavery in Massachusetts</i>, which Garrison had published

      the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
      old fanatic of Ossawatomie changed Thoreau into a complete citizen,
      arguing the case and glorifying to his neighbors the dead hero. "It seems
      as if no man had ever died in America before; for in order to die you must
      first have lived.&hellip; I hear a good many pretend that they are going
      to die.&hellip; Nonsense! I'll defy them to do it. They haven't got life
      enough in them. They'll deliquesce like fungi, and keep a hundred
      eulogists mopping the spot where they left off. Only half a dozen or so
      have died since the world began." Such passages as this reveal a very
      different Thoreau from the Thoreau who is supposed to have spent his days
      in the company of swamp-blackbirds and woodchucks. He had, in fact, one of
      the highest qualifications for human society, an absolute honesty of mind.
      "We select granite," he says, "for the underpinning of our houses and
      barns; we build fences of stone; but we do not ourselves rest on an
      underpinning of granite truth, the lowest primitive rock. Our sills are
      rotten.&hellip; In proportion as our inward life fails, we go more
      constantly and desperately to the post-office. You may depend upon it,
      that the poor fellow who walks away with the greatest number of letters,
      proud of his extensive <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139"
      id="Page_139">139</a></span> correspondence, has not heard from himself
      this long time."
    </p>
    <p>
      This hard, basic individualism was for Thoreau the foundation of all
      enduring social relations, and the dullest observer of twentieth century
      America can see that Thoreau's doctrine is needed as much as ever. His
      sharp-edged personality provokes curiosity and pricks the reader into
      dissent or emulation as the case may be, but its chief ethical value to
      our generation lies in the fact that here was a Transcendentalist who
      stressed, not the life of the senses, though he was well aware of their
      seductiveness, but the stubborn energy of the will.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scope of the present book prevents more than a glimpse at the other
      members of the New England Transcendental group. They are a very mixed
      company, noble, whimsical, queer, impossible. "The good Alcott," wrote
      Carlyle, "with his long, lean face and figure, with his gray worn temples
      and mild radiant eyes; all bent on saving the world by a return to acorns
      and the golden age; he comes before one like a venerable Don Quixote, whom
      nobody can laugh at without loving." These words paint a whole company, as
      well as a single man. The good Alcott still awaits an adequate biographer.
      Connecticut Yankee, peddler <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140"
      id="Page_140">140</a></span> in the South, school-teacher in Boston and
      elsewhere, he descended upon Concord, flitted to the queer community of
      Fruitlands, was starved back to Concord, inspired and bored the patient
      Emerson, talked endlessly, wrote ineffective books, and had at last his
      apotheosis in the Concord School of Philosophy, but was chiefly known for
      the twenty years before his death in 1888 as the father of the Louisa
      Alcott who wrote <i>Little Women</i>. "A tedious archangel," was Emerson's
      verdict, and it is likely to stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret Fuller, though sketched by Hawthorne, analyzed by Emerson, and
      painted at full length by Thomas Wentworth Higginson, is now a fading
      figure&mdash;a remarkable woman, no doubt, one of the first of American
      feminists, suggesting George Eliot in her physical unattractiveness, her
      clear brain, her touch of sensuousness. She was an early-ripe,
      over-crammed scholar in the classics and in modern European languages. She
      did loyal, unpaid work as the editor of the <i>Dial</i>, which from 1840
      to 1844 was the organ of Transcendentalism. She joined the community at
      Brook Farm, whose story has been so well told by Lindsay Swift. For a
      while she served as literary editor of the <i>New York Tribune</i> under
      Horace Greeley. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
      Then she went abroad, touched Rousseau's manuscripts at Paris with
      trembling, adoring fingers, made a secret marriage in Italy with the young
      Marquis Ossoli, and perished by shipwreck, with her husband and child, off
      Fire Island in 1850.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodore Parker, like Alcott and "Margaret," an admirable Greek scholar,
      an idealist and reformer, still lives in Chadwick's biography, in Colonel
      Higginson's delightful essay, and in the memories of a few liberal
      Bostonians who remember his tremendous sermons on the platform of the old
      Music Hall. He was a Lexington farmer's son, with the temperament of a
      blacksmith, with enormous, restless energy, a good hater, a passionate
      lover of all excellent things save meekness. He died at fifty, worn out,
      in Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while these three figures were, after Emerson and Thoreau, the most
      representative of the group, the student of the Transcendental period will
      be equally interested in watching its influence upon many other types of
      young men: upon future journalists and publicists like George William
      Curtis, Charles A. Dana, and George Ripley; upon religionists like Orestes
      Brownson, Father Hecker, and James Freeman Clarke; and upon poets like
      Jones Very, Christopher P. Cranch, and <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span> Ellery Channing. There was a
      sunny side of the whole movement, as T.&nbsp;W. Higginson and F.&nbsp;B.
      Sanborn, two of the latest survivors of the ferment, loved to emphasize in
      their talk and in their books; and it was shadowed also by tragedy and the
      pathos of unfulfilled desires. But as one looks back at it, in the
      perspective of three-quarters of a century, it seems chiefly something
      touchingly fine. For all these men and women tried to hitch their wagon to
      a star.

      <span class="smcap">Moving</span> in and out of the Transcendentalist
      circles, in that great generation preceding the Civil War, were a company
      of other men&mdash;romancers, poets, essayists, historians&mdash;who
      shared in the intellectual liberalism of the age, but who were more purely
      artists in prose and verse than they were seekers after the unattainable.
      Hawthorne, for example, sojourned at Concord and at Brook Farm with some
      of the most extreme types of transcendental extravagance. The movement
      interested him artistically and he utilized it in his romances, but
      personally he maintained an attitude of cool detachment from it.
      Longfellow was too much of an artist to lose his head over philosophical
      abstractions; Whittier, at his best, had a too genuine poetic instinct for
      the concrete; and Lowell and Holmes had the saving gift of humor.

      preferred to keep their feet on the solid earth and write admirable
      histories. So the mellow years went by. Most of the widely-read American
      books were being produced within twenty miles of the Boston State House.
      The slavery issue kept growling, far away, but it was only now and then,
      as in the enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, that it was
      brought sharply home to the North. The "golden forties" were as truly
      golden for New England as for idle California. There was wealth, leisure,
      books, a glow of harvest-time in the air, though the spirit of the writers
      is the spirit of youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nathaniel Hawthorne, our greatest writer of pure romance, was Puritan by
      inheritance and temperament, though not in doctrine or in sympathy. His
      literary affiliations were with the English and German Romanticists, and
      he possessed, for professional use, the ideas and vocabulary of his
      transcendental friends. Born in Salem in 1804, he was descended from Judge
      Hawthorne of Salem Witchcraft fame, and from a long line of sea-faring
      ancestors. He inherited a morbid solitariness, redeemed in some measure by
      a physical endowment of rare strength and beauty. He read Spenser,
      Rousseau, and the <i>Newgate Calendar</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span> was graduated at Bowdoin,
      with Longfellow, in the class of 1825, and returned to Salem for thirteen
      brooding lonely years in which he tried to teach himself the art of
      story-writing. His earliest tales, like Irving's, are essays in which
      characters emerge; he is absorbed in finding a setting for a preconceived
      "moral"; he is in love with allegory and parable. His own words about his
      first collection of stories, <i>Twice-Told Tales</i>, have often been
      quoted: "They have the pale tint of flowers that blossomed in too retired
      a shade." Yet they are for the most part exquisitely written. After a
      couple of years in the Boston Custom-House, and a residence at the
      socialistic community of Brook Farm, Hawthorne made the happiest of
      marriages to Sophia Peabody, and for nearly four years dwelt in the Old
      Manse at Concord. He described it in one of the ripest of his essays, the
      Preface to <i>Mosses from an Old Manse</i>, his second collection of
      stories. After three years in the Custom-House at Salem, his dismissal in
      1849 gave him leisure to produce his masterpiece, <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>,
      published in 1850. He was now forty-six. In 1851, he published <i>The
      House of the Seven Gables</i>, <i>The Wonder-Book</i>, and <i>The
      Snow-Image, and Other Tales</i>. In 1852 came <i>The</i> <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span> <i>Blithedale
      Romance</i>, a rich ironical story drawn from his Brook Farm experience.
      Four years in the American Consulate at Liverpool and three subsequent
      years of residence upon the Continent saw no literary harvest except
      carefully filled notebooks and the deeply imaginative moral romance, <i>The
      Marble Faun</i>. Hawthorne returned home in 1860 and settled in the
      Wayside at Concord, busying himself with a new, and, as was destined, a
      never completed story about the elixir of immortality. But his vitality
      was ebbing, and in May, 1864, he passed away in his sleep. He rests under
      the pines in Sleepy Hollow, near the Alcotts and the Emersons.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is difficult for contemporary Americans to assess the value of such a
      man, who evidently did nothing except to write a few books. His rare,
      delicate genius was scarcely touched by passing events. Not many of his
      countrymen really love his writings, as they love, for instance the
      writings of Dickens or Thackeray or Stevenson. Everyone reads, at some
      time of his life, <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>, and trembles at its
      passionate indictment of the sin of concealment, at its agonized
      admonition, "Be true! Be true!" Perhaps the happiest memories of
      Hawthorne's readers, as of Kipling's <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span> readers, hover about his
      charming stories for children; to have missed <i>The Wonder-Book</i> is
      like having grown old without ever catching the sweetness of the green
      world at dawn. But our public has learned to enjoy a wholly different kind
      of style, taught by the daily journals, a nervous, graphic, sensational,
      physical style, fit for describing an automobile, a department store, a
      steamship, a lynching party. It is the style of our day, and judged by it
      Hawthorne, who wrote with severity, conscience, and good taste, seems
      somewhat old-fashioned, like Irving or Addison. He is perhaps too
      completely a New Englander to be understood by men of other stock, and has
      never, like Poe and Whitman, excited strong interest among European minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet no American is surer, generation after generation, of finding a fit
      audience. Hawthorne's genius was meditative rather than dramatic. His
      artistic material was moral rather than physical; he brooded over the soul
      of man as affected by this and that condition and situation. The child of
      a new analytical age, he thought out with rigid accuracy the precise
      circumstances surrounding each one of his cases and modifying it. Many of
      his sketches and short stories and most of his <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span> romances deal with historical
      facts, moods, and atmospheres, and he knew the past of New England as few
      men have ever known it. There is solid historical and psychological stuff
      as the foundation of his air-castles. His latent radicalism furnished him
      with a touchstone of criticism as he interpreted the moral standards of
      ancient communities; no reader of <i>The Scarlet Letter</i> can forget
      Hawthorne's implicit condemnation of the unimaginative harshness of the
      Puritans. His own judgment upon the deep matters of the human conscience
      was stern enough, but it was a universalized judgment, and by no means the
      result of a Calvinism which he hated. Over-fond as he was in his earlier
      tales of elaborate, fanciful, decorative treatment of themes that promised
      to point a moral, in his finest short stories, such as <i>The Ambitious
      Guest</i>, <i>The Gentle Boy</i>, <i>Young Goodman Brown</i>, <i>The Snow
      Image</i>, <i>The Great Stone Face</i>, <i>Drowne's Wooden Image</i>, <i>Rappacini's
      Daughter</i>, the moral, if there be one, is not obtruded. He loves
      physical symbols for mental and moral states, and was poet and
      Transcendentalist enough to retain his youthful affection for parables;
      but his true field as a story-teller is the erring, questing, aspiring,
      shadowed human heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span> <i>The
      Scarlet Letter</i>, for instance, is a study of a universal theme, the
      problem of concealed sin, punishment, redemption. Only the setting is
      provincial. The story cannot be rightly estimated, it is true, without
      remembering the Puritan reverence for physical purity, the Puritan
      reverence for the magistrate-minister&mdash;differing so widely from the
      respect of Latin countries for the priest&mdash;the Puritan preoccupation
      with the life of the soul, or, as more narrowly construed by Calvinism,
      the problem of evil. The word Adultery, although suggestively enough
      present in one of the finest symbolical titles ever devised by a romancer,
      does not once occur in the book. The sins dealt with are hypocrisy and
      revenge. Arthur Dimmesdale, Hester Prynne, and Roger Chillingworth are
      developing, suffering, living creatures, caught inextricably in the toils
      of a moral situation. By an incomparable succession of pictures Hawthorne
      exhibits the travail of their souls. In the greatest scene of all, that
      between Hester and Arthur in the forest, the Puritan framework of the
      story gives way beneath the weight of human passion, and we seem on the
      verge of another and perhaps larger solution than was actually worked out
      by the logic of succeeding events. But though the <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span> book has been called
      Christless, prayerless, hopeless, no mature person ever reads it without a
      deepened sense of the impotence of all mechanistic theories of sin, and a
      new vision of the intense reality of spiritual things. "The law we broke,"
      in Dimmesdale's ghostly words, was a more subtle law than can be graven on
      tables of stone and numbered as the Seventh Commandment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The legacy of guilt is likewise the theme of <i>The House of the Seven
      Gables</i>, which Hawthorne himself was inclined to think a better book
      than <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>. Certainly this story of old Salem is
      impeccably written and its subtle handling of tone and atmosphere is
      beyond dispute. An ancestral curse, the visitation of the sins of the
      fathers upon the children, the gradual decay of a once sound stock, are
      motives that Ibsen might have developed. But the Norseman would have
      failed to rival Hawthorne's delicate manipulation of his shadows, and the
      no less masterly deftness of the ultimate mediation of a dark inheritance
      through the love of the light-hearted Ph&oelig;be for the latest
      descendant of the Maules. In <i>The Blithedale Romance</i> Hawthorne stood
      for once, perhaps, too near his material to allow the rich atmospheric
      effects which he prefers, and in spite of the unforgetable <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span> portrait
      of Zenobia and powerful passages of realistic description, the book is not
      quite focussed. In <i>The Marble Faun</i> Hawthorne comes into his own
      again. Its central problem is one of those dark insoluble ones that he
      loves: the influence of a crime upon the development of a soul. Donatello,
      the Faun, is a charming young creature of the natural sunshine until his
      love for the somber Miriam tempts him to the commission of murder: then
      begins the growth of his mind and character. Perhaps the haunting power of
      the main theme of the book has contributed less to its fame than the
      felicity of its descriptions of Rome and Italy. For Hawthorne possessed,
      like Byron, in spite of his defective training in the appreciation of the
      arts, a gift of romantic discernment which makes <i>The Marble Faun</i>,
      like <i>Childe Harold</i>, a glorified guide-book to the Eternal City.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of Hawthorne's books, in short, have a central core of psychological
      romance, and a rich surface finish of description. His style, at its best,
      has a subdued splendor of coloring which is only less wonderful than the
      spiritual perceptions with which this magician was endowed. The gloom
      which haunts many of his pages, as I have said elsewhere, is the long
      shadow cast by our mortal <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152"
      id="Page_152">152</a></span> destiny upon a sensitive soul. The mystery is
      our mystery, perceived, and not created, by that finely endowed mind and
      heart. The shadow is our shadow; the gleams of insight, the soft radiance
      of truth and beauty, are his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      A college classmate of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow summed up the Portland
      boy's character in one sentence: "It appeared easy for him to avoid the
      unworthy." Born in 1807, of <i>Mayflower</i> stock that had distinguished
      itself for bravery and uprightness, the youth was graduated from Bowdoin
      at eighteen. Like his classmate Hawthorne, he had been a wide and secretly
      ambitious reader, and had followed the successive numbers of Irving's <i>Sketch
      Book</i>, he tells us, "with ever increasing wonder and delight." His
      college offered him in 1826 a professorship of the modern languages, and
      he spent three happy years in Europe in preparation. He taught
      successfully at Bowdoin for five or six years, and for eighteen years,
      1836 to 1854, served as George Ticknor's successor at Harvard, ultimately
      surrendering the chair to Lowell. He early published two prose volumes, <i>Hyperion</i>
      and <i>Outre-mer</i>, Irvingesque romances of European travel. Then came,
      after ten years of teaching and the death <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span> of his young wife, the sudden
      impulse to write poetry, and he produced, "softly excited, I know not
      why," <i>The Reaper and the Flowers, a Psalm of Death</i>. From that
      December morning in 1838 until his death in 1882 he was Longfellow the
      Poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      His outward life, like Hawthorne's, was barren of dramatic incident, save
      the one tragic accident by which his second wife, the mother of his
      children, perished before his eyes in 1861. He bore the calamity with the
      quiet courage of his race and breeding. But otherwise his days ran softly
      and gently, enriched with books and friendships, sheltered from the storms
      of circumstance. He had leisure to grow ripe, to remember, and to dream.
      But he never secluded himself, like Tennyson, from normal contacts with
      his fellowmen. The owner of the Craigie House was a good neighbor,
      approachable and deferential. He was even interested in local Cambridge
      politics. On the larger political issues of his day his Americanism was
      sound and loyal. "It is disheartening," he wrote in his Cambridge journal
      for 1851, "to see how little sympathy there is in the hearts of the young
      men here for freedom and great ideas." But his own sympathy never wavered.
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span> His
      linguistic talent helped him to penetrate the secrets of alien ways of
      thought and speech. He understood Italy and Spain, Holland and France and
      Germany. He had studied them on the lips of their living men and women and
      in the books where soldier and historian, priest and poet, had inscribed
      the record of five hundred years. From the Revival of Learning to the
      middle of the nineteenth century, Longfellow knew the soul of Europe as
      few men have known it, and he helped to translate Europe to America. His
      intellectual receptivity, his quick eye for color and costume and
      landscape, his ear for folk-lore and ballad, his own ripe mastery of
      words, made him the most resourceful of international interpreters. And
      this lover of children, walking in quiet ways, this refined and courteous
      host and gentleman, scholar and poet, exemplified without
      self-advertisement the richer qualities of his own people. When Couper's
      statue of Longfellow was dedicated in Washington, Hamilton Mabie said:
      "His freedom from the sophistication of a more experienced country; his
      simplicity, due in large measure to the absence of social
      self-consciousness; his tranquil and deep-seated optimism, which is the
      effluence of an unexhausted soil; his <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span> happy and confident
      expectation, born of a sense of tremendous national vitality; his love of
      simple things in normal relations to world-wide interests of the mind; his
      courage in interpreting those deeper experiences which craftsmen who know
      art but who do not know life call commonplaces; the unaffected and
      beautiful democracy of his spirit&mdash;these are the delicate flowers of
      our new world, and as much a part of it as its stretches of wilderness and
      the continental roll of its rivers."
    </p>
    <p>
      Longfellow's poetic service to his countrymen has thus become a national
      asset, and not merely because in his three best known narrative poems, <i>Evangeline</i>,
      <i>Hiawatha</i>, and <i>The Courtship of Miles Standish</i>, he selected
      his themes from our own history. <i>The Building of the Ship</i>, written
      with full faith in the troubled year of 1849, is a national anthem. "It is
      a wonderful gift," said Lincoln, as he listened to it, his eyes filled
      with tears, "to be able to stir men like that." <i>The Skeleton in Armor</i>,
      <i>A Ballad of the French Fleet</i>, <i>Paul Revere's Ride</i>, <i>The
      Wreck of the Hesperus</i>, are ballads that stir men still. For all of his
      skill in story-telling in verse&mdash;witness the <i>Tales of a Wayside
      Inn</i>&mdash;Longfellow was not by nature a dramatist, and his trilogy
      now published under the title of <i>Christus</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span> made up of <i>The Divine
      Tragedy</i>, <i>The Golden Legend</i>, and <i>New England Tragedies</i>,
      added little to a reputation won in other fields. His sonnets,
      particularly those upon <i>Chaucer</i>, <i>Milton</i>, <i>The Divina
      Commedia</i>, <i>A Nameless Grave</i>, <i>Felton</i>, <i>Sumner</i>, <i>Nature</i>,
      <i>My Books</i>, are among the imperishable treasures of the English
      language. In descriptive pieces like <i>Keramos</i> and <i>The Hanging of
      the Crane</i>, in such personal and occasional verses as <i>The Herons of
      Elmwood</i>, <i>The Fiftieth Birthday of Agassiz</i>, and the noble <i>Morituri
      Salutamus</i> written for his classmates in 1875, he exhibits his
      tenderness of affection and all the ripeness of his technical skill. But
      it was as a lyric poet, after all, that he won and held his immense
      audience throughout the English-speaking world. Two of the most popular of
      all his early pieces, <i>The Psalm of Life</i> and <i>Excelsior</i>, have
      paid the price of a too apt adjustment to the ethical mood of an earnest
      moment in our national life. We have passed beyond them. And many readers
      may have outgrown their youthful pleasure in <i>Maidenhood</i>, <i>The
      Rainy Day</i>, <i>The Bridge</i>, <i>The Day is Done</i>, verses whose
      simplicity lent themselves temptingly to parody. Yet such poems as <i>The
      Belfry of Bruges</i>, <i>Seaweed</i>, <i>The Fire of Driftwood</i>, <i>The
      Arsenal at Springfield</i>, <i>My Lost Youth</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span> <i>The Children's Hour</i>,
      and many another lyric, lose nothing with the lapse of time. There is
      fortunately infinite room for personal preference in this whole matter of
      poetry, but the confession of a lack of regard for Longfellow's verse must
      often be recognized as a confession of a lessening love for what is
      simple, graceful, and refined. The current of contemporary American taste,
      especially among consciously clever, half-trained persons, seems to be
      running against Longfellow. How soon the tide may turn, no one can say.
      Meanwhile he has his tranquil place in the Poet's Corner of Westminster
      Abbey. The Abbey must be a pleasant spot to wait in, for the Portland boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oddly enough, some of the over-sophisticated and under-experienced people
      who affect to patronize Longfellow assume toward John Greenleaf Whittier
      an air of deference. This attitude would amuse the Quaker poet. One can
      almost see his dark eyes twinkle and the grim lips tighten in that silent
      laughter in which the old man so much resembled Cooper's Leather-Stocking.
      Whittier knew that his friend Longfellow was a better artist than himself,
      and he also knew, by intimate experience as a maker of public opinion, how
      variable are its judgments.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
      Whittier represents a stock different from that of the Longfellows, but
      equally American, equally thoroughbred: the Essex County Quaker farmer of
      Massachusetts. The homestead in which he was born in 1807, at East
      Haverhill, had been built by his great-great-grandfather in 1688. Mount
      Vernon in Virginia and the Craigie House in Cambridge are newer than this
      by two generations. The house has been restored to the precise aspect it
      had in Whittier's boyhood: and the garden, lawn, and brook, even the
      door-stone and bridle-post and the barn across the road are witnesses to
      the fidelity of the descriptions in <i>Snow-Bound</i>. The neighborhood is
      still a lonely one. The youth grew up in seclusion, yet in contact with a
      few great ideas, chief among them Liberty. "My father," he said, "was an
      old-fashioned Democrat, and really believed in the Preamble of the Bill of
      Rights which reaffirmed the Declaration of Independence." The taciturn
      father transmitted to his sons a hatred of kingcraft and priestcraft, the
      inward moral freedom of the Quaker touched with humanitarian passion. The
      spirit of a boyhood in this homestead is veraciously told in <i>The
      Barefoot Boy</i>, <i>School-Days</i>, <i>Snow-Bound</i>, <i>Ramoth Hill</i>,
      and <i>Telling the Bees</i>. It was a chance <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span> copy of Burns that revealed
      to the farmer lad his own desire and capacity for verse-writing. When he
      was nineteen, his sister sent his <i>Exile's Departure</i> to William
      Lloyd Garrison, then twenty, and the editor of the <i>Newburyport Free
      Press</i>. The neighbors liked it, and the tall frail author was rewarded
      with a term at the Haverhill Academy, where he paid his way, in old Essex
      County fashion, by making shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had little more formal schooling than this, was too poor to enter
      college, but had what he modestly called a "knack at rhyming," and much
      facility in prose. He turned to journalism and politics, for which he
      possessed a notable instinct. For a while he thought he had "done with
      poetry and literature." Then in 1833, at twenty-six, came Garrison's
      stirring letter bidding him enlist in the cause of Anti-Slavery. He obeyed
      the call, not knowing that this new allegiance to the service of humanity
      was to transform him from a facile local verse-writer into a national
      poet. It was the ancient miracle of losing one's life and finding it. For
      the immediate sacrifice was very real to a youth trained in quietism and
      non-resistance, and well aware, as a Whig journalist, of the ostracism
      visited upon the active <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160"
      id="Page_160">160</a></span> Abolitionists. Whittier entered the fight
      with absolute courage and with the shrewdest practical judgment of weapons
      and tactics. He forgot himself. He turned aside from those pleasant fields
      of New England legend and history to which he was destined to return after
      his warfare was accomplished. He had read the prose of Milton and of
      Burke. He perceived that negro emancipation in the United States was only
      a single and immediate phase of a universal movement of liberalism. The
      thought kindled his imagination. He wrote, at white heat, political and
      social verse that glowed with humanitarian passion: lyrics in praise of
      fellow-workers, salutes to the dead, campaign songs, hymns, satires
      against the clergy and the capitalists, superb sectional poems like <i>Massachusetts
      to Virginia</i>, and, more nobly still, poems embodying what Wordsworth
      called "the sensation and image of country and the human race."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whittier had now "found himself" as a poet. It is true that his style
      remained diffuse and his ear faulty, but his countrymen, then as now
      uncritical of artistic form, overlooked the blemishes of his verse, and
      thought only of his vibrant emotion, his scorn of cowardice and evil, his
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
      prophetic exaltation. In 1847 came the first general collection of his
      poems, and here were to be found not merely controversial verses, but
      spirited <i>Songs of Labor</i>, pictures of the lovely Merrimac
      countryside, legends written in the mood of Hawthorne or Longfellow, and
      bright bits of foreign lore and fancy. For though Whittier never went
      abroad, his quiet life at Amesbury gave him leisure for varied reading,
      and he followed contemporary European politics with the closest interest.
      He emerged more and more from the atmosphere of faction and section, and,
      though he retained to the last his Quaker creed, he held its simple tenets
      in such undogmatic and winning fashion that his hymns are sung today in
      all the churches.
    </p>
    <p>
      When <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i> was established in 1857, Whittier was
      fifty. He took his place among the contributors to the new magazine not as
      a controversialist but as a man of letters, with such poems as <i>Tritemius</i>,
      and <i>Skipper Ireson's Ride</i>. Characteristic productions of this
      period are <i>My Psalm</i>, <i>Cobbler Keezar's Vision</i>, <i>Andrew
      Rykman's Prayer</i>, <i>The Eternal Goodness</i>&mdash;poems grave, sweet,
      and tender. But it was not until the publication of <i>Snow-Bound</i> in
      1866 that Whittier's <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
      work touched its widest popularity. He had never married, and the deaths
      of his mother and sister Elizabeth set him brooding, in the desolate
      Amesbury house, over memories of his birthplace, six miles away in East
      Haverhill. The homestead had gone out of the hands of the Whittiers, and
      the poet, nearing sixty, set himself to compose an idyll descriptive of
      the vanished past. No artist could have a theme more perfectly adapted to
      his mood and to his powers. There are no novel ideas in <i>Snow-Bound</i>,
      nor is there any need of them, but the thousands of annual pilgrims to the
      old farmhouse can bear witness to the touching intimacy, the homely charm,
      the unerring rightness of feeling with which Whittier's genius recreated
      his own lost youth and painted for all time a true New England hearthside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whittier was still to write nearly two hundred more poems, for he lived to
      be eighty-five, and he composed until the last. But his creative period
      was now over. He rejoiced in the friendly recognition of his work that
      came to him from every section of a reunited country. His personal friends
      were loyal in their devotion. He followed the intricacies of American
      politics with the keen <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163"
      id="Page_163">163</a></span> zest of a veteran in that game, for in his
      time he had made and unmade governors and senators. "The greatest
      politician I have ever met," said James G. Blaine, who had certainly met
      many. He had an income from his poems far in excess of his needs, but
      retained the absolute simplicity of his earlier habits. When his
      publishers first proposed the notable public dinner in honor of his
      seventieth birthday he demurred, explaining to a member of his family that
      he did not want the bother of "buying a new pair of pants"&mdash;a petty
      anecdote, but somehow refreshing. So the rustic, shrewd, gentle old man
      waited for the end. He had known what it means to toil, to fight, to
      renounce, to eat his bread in tears, and to see some of his dreams come
      true. We have had, and shall have, more accomplished craftsmen in verse,
      but we have never bred a more genuine man than Whittier, nor one who had
      more kinship with the saints.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days before Whittier's death, he wrote an affectionate poem in
      celebration of the eighty-third birthday of his old friend of the Saturday
      Club, Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes. This was in 1892. The little Doctor,
      rather lonely in his latest years, composed some tender obituary verses
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span> at
      Whittier's passing. He had already performed the same office for Lowell.
      He lingered himself until the autumn of 1894, in his eighty-sixth year&mdash;<i>The
      Last Leaf</i>, in truth, of New England's richest springtime.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my friends," he had said in <i>The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table</i>,
      "I go (always, other things being equal) for the man who inherits family
      traditions and the cumulative humanities of at least four or five
      generations." The Doctor came naturally by his preference for a "man of
      family," being one himself. He was a descendant of Anne Bradstreet, the
      poetess. "Dorothy Q.," whom he had made the most picturesque of the
      Quincys, was his great-grandmother. Wendell Phillips was his cousin. His
      father, the Rev. Abiel Holmes, a Yale graduate, was the minister of the
      First Church in Cambridge, and it was in its "gambrel-roofed" parsonage
      that Oliver Wendell was born in 1809.
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Know old Cambridge? Hope you do.&mdash;<br /> Born there? Don't say so! I
      was, too.<br /> <span class="big-word-space"> &bull; &bull; &bull; &bull;
      &bull; &bull; &bull; &bull;</span><br /> Nicest place that was ever seen&mdash;<br />
      Colleges red and Common green.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he wrote, in scores of passages of filial devotion, concerning the
      village of his boyhood and the city of <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span> Boston. His best-known prose
      sentence is: "Boston State House is the hub of the Solar System." It is
      easy to smile, as indeed he did himself, at such fond provinciality, but
      the fact remains that our literature as a whole sadly needs this richness
      of local atmosphere. A nation of restless immigrants, here today and
      "moved on" tomorrow, has the fibres of its imagination uprooted, and its
      artists in their eager quest of "local color" purchase brilliancy at the
      cost of thinness of tone, poverty of association. Philadelphia and Boston,
      almost alone among the larger American cities, yield the sense of
      intimacy, or what the Autocrat would call "the cumulative humanities."
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Holmes became the pet and the glory of his class of 1829 at Harvard.
      It was only in 1838 that their reunions began, but thereafter they held
      fifty-six meetings, of which Holmes attended fifty and wrote poems for
      forty-three. Many of "the Boys" whom he celebrated became famous in their
      own right, but they remain "the Boys" to all lovers of Holmes's verses.
      His own career as a poet had begun during his single year in the Law
      School. His later years brought him some additional skill in polishing his
      lines and a riper human <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166"
      id="Page_166">166</a></span> wisdom, but his native verse-making talent is
      as completely revealed in <i>Old Ironsides</i>, published when he was
      twenty-one, and in <i>The Last Leaf</i>, composed a year or two later, as
      in anything he was to write during the next half-century. In many respects
      he was a curious survival of the cumulative humanities of the eighteenth
      century. He might have been, like good Dr. Arbuthnot, an ornament of the
      Augustan age. He shared with the English Augustans a liking for the rhymed
      couplet, an instinctive social sense, a feeling for the presence of an
      imaginary audience of congenial listeners. One still catches the "Hear!
      Hear!" between his clever lines. In many of the traits of his mind this
      "Yankee Frenchman" resembled such a typical eighteenth century figure as
      Voltaire. Like Voltaire, he was tolerant&mdash;except toward Calvinism and
      Homeopathy. In some of the tricks of his prose style he is like a kindlier
      Sterne. His knack for <i>vers de soci&eacute;t&eacute;</i> was caught from
      Horace, but he would not have been a child of his own age without the
      additional gift of rhetoric and eloquence which is to be seen in his
      patriotic poems and his hymns. For Holmes possessed, in spite of all his
      limitations in poetic range, true devotion, patriotism, humor, and pathos.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span> His
      poetry was in the best sense of the word "occasional," and his prose was
      only an incidental or accidental harvest of a long career in which his
      chief duty was that of a professor of anatomy in the Harvard Medical
      School. He had studied in Paris under sound teachers, and after some years
      of private practice won the appointment which he held, as active and
      emeritus professor, for forty-seven years. He was a faithful, clear, and
      amusing lecturer, and printed two or three notable medical essays, but his
      chief Boston reputation, in the eighteen-fifties, was that of a wit and
      diner-out and writer of verses for occasions. Then came his great hour of
      good luck in 1857, when Lowell, the editor of the newly-established <i>Atlantic
      Monthly</i>, persuaded him to write <i>The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table</i>.
      It was the public's luck also, for whoever had been so unfortunate as not
      to be born in Boston could now listen&mdash;as if across the table&mdash;to
      Boston's best talker. Few volumes of essays during the last sixty years
      have given more pleasure to a greater variety of readers than is yielded
      by <i>The Autocrat</i>. It gave the Doctor a reputation in England which
      he naturally prized, and which contributed to his triumphal English
      progress, many years later, recorded pleasantly in <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span> <i>Our Hundred Days</i>. <i>The
      Professor at the Breakfast Table</i> and <i>The Poet at the Breakfast
      Table</i> are less successful variations of <i>The Autocrat</i>. Neither
      professors nor poets are at their best at this meal. Holmes wrote three
      novels&mdash;of which <i>Elsie Venner</i>, a somewhat too medical story,
      is the best remembered&mdash;memoirs of his friends Emerson and Motley,
      and many miscellaneous essays. His life was exceptionally happy, and his
      cheery good opinion of himself is still contagious. To pronounce the words
      Doctor Holmes in any company of intelligent Americans is the prologue to a
      smile of recognition, comprehension, sympathy. The word Goldsmith has now
      lost, alas, this provocative quality; the word Stevenson still possesses
      it. The little Doctor, who died in the same year as Stevenson, belonged
      like him to the genial race of friends of mankind, and a few of his poems,
      and some gay warm-hearted pages of his prose, will long preserve his
      memory. But the Boston which he loved has vanished as utterly as Sam
      Johnson's London.
    </p>
    <p>
      James Russell Lowell was ten years younger than Holmes, and though he died
      three years before the Doctor, he seems, for other reasons than those of
      chronology, to belong more nearly to the <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span> present. Although by birth as
      much of a New England Brahmin as Holmes, and in his later years as much of
      a Boston and Cambridge idol, he nevertheless touched our universal
      American life on many sides, represented us worthily in foreign diplomacy,
      argued the case of Democracy with convincing power, and embodied, as more
      perfect artists like Hawthorne and Longfellow could never have done, the
      subtleties and potencies of the national temperament. He deserves and
      reveals the closest scrutiny, but his personality is difficult to put on
      paper. Horace Scudder wrote his biography with careful competence, and
      Ferris Greenslet has made him the subject of a brilliant critical study.
      Yet readers differ widely in their assessment of the value of his prose
      and verse, and in their understanding of his personality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The external facts of his career are easy to trace and must be set down
      here with brevity. A minister's son, and descended from a very old and
      distinguished family, he was born at Elmwood in Cambridge in 1819. After a
      somewhat turbulent course, he was graduated from Harvard in 1838, the year
      of Emerson's <i>Divinity School Address</i>. He studied law, turned
      Abolitionist, wrote poetry, married the beautiful and transcendental <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span> Maria
      White, and did magazine work in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. He was
      thought by his friends in the eighteen-fifties to be "the most
      Shakespearian" man in America. When he was ten years out of college, in
      1848, he published <i>The Biglow Papers</i> (First Series), <i>A Fable for
      Critics</i>, and <i>The Vision of Sir Launfal</i>. After a long visit to
      Europe and the death of his wife, he gave some brilliant Lowell Institute
      lectures in Boston, and was appointed Longfellow's successor at Harvard.
      He went to Europe again to prepare himself, and after entering upon his
      work as a teacher made a happy second marriage, served for four years as
      the first editor of <i>The Atlantic</i>, and helped his friend Charles
      Eliot Norton edit <i>The North American Review</i>. The Civil War inspired
      a second series of <i>Biglow Papers</i> and the magnificent <i>Commemoration
      Ode</i> of 1865. Then came volume after volume of literary essays, such as
      <i>Among My Books</i> and <i>My Study Windows</i>, and an occasional book
      of verse. Again he made a long sojourn in Europe, resigned his Harvard
      professorship, and in 1877 was appointed Minister to Spain. After three
      years he was transferred to the most important post in our diplomatic
      service, London. He performed his duties with <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span> extraordinary skill and
      success until 1885, when he was relieved. His last years were spent in
      Elmwood, the Cambridge house where he was born, and he was still writing,
      in almost as rich a vein as ever, when the end came in 1891.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was certainly a full and varied life, responsive to many personal
      moods and many tides of public feeling. Lowell drew intellectual stimulus
      from enormously wide reading in classical and modern literatures.
      Puritanically earnest by inheritance, he seems also to have inherited a
      strain of levity which he could not always control, and, through his
      mother's family, a dash of mysticism sometimes resembling second sight.
      His physical and mental powers were not always in the happiest mutual
      adjustment: he became easily the prey of moods and fancies, and knew the
      alternations from wild gaiety of spirits to black despair. The firm moral
      consistency of Puritanism was always his, yet his playful remark about
      belonging in a hospital for incurable children had a measure of truth in
      it also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both his poetry and his prose reveal a nature never quite integrated into
      wholeness of structure, into harmony with itself. His writing, at its
      best, is noble and delightful, full of human charm, <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span> but it is difficult for him
      to master a certain waywardness and to sustain any note steadily. This
      temperamental flaw does not affect the winsomeness of his letters, unless
      to add to it. It is lost to view, often, in the sincerity and pathos of
      his lyrics, but it is felt in most of his longer efforts in prose, and
      accounts for a certain dissatisfaction which many grateful and loyal
      readers nevertheless feel in his criticism. Lowell was more richly endowed
      by nature and by breadth of reading than Matthew Arnold, for instance, but
      in the actual performance of the critical function he was surpassed in
      method by Arnold and perhaps in inerrant perception, in a limited field,
      by Poe.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as a poet, however, that he first won his place in our literature,
      and it is by means of certain passages in the <i>Biglow Papers</i> and the
      <i>Commemoration Ode</i> that he has most moved his countrymen. The
      effectiveness of <i>The Present Crisis</i> and <i>Sir Launfal</i>, and of
      the <i>Memorial Odes</i>, particularly the <i>Ode to Agassiz</i>, is
      likewise due to the passion, sweetness, and splendor of certain strophes,
      rather than to the perfection of these poems as artistic wholes. Lowell's
      personal lyrics of sorrow, such as <i>The Changeling</i>, <i>The First
      Snow-Fall</i>, <i>After the Burial</i>, have touched many hearts. <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span> His later
      lyrics are more subtle, weighted with thought, tinged with autumnal
      melancholy. He was a most fertile composer, and, like all the men of his
      time and group, produced too much. Yet his patriotic verse was so
      admirable in feeling and is still so inspiring to his readers that one
      cannot wish it less in quantity; and in the field of political satire,
      such as the two series of <i>Biglow Papers</i>, he had a theme and a
      method precisely suited to his temperament. No American has approached
      Lowell's success in this difficult <i>genre</i>: the swift transitions
      from rural Yankee humor to splendid scorn of evil and to noblest idealism
      reveal the full powers of one of our most gifted men. The preacher lurked
      in this Puritan from first to last, and the war against Mexico and the
      Civil War stirred him to the depths.

    <p>
      His prose, likewise, is a school of loyalty. There was much of Europe in
      his learning, as his memorable Dante essay shows, and the traditions of
      great English literature were the daily companions of his mind. He was
      bookish, as a bookman should be, and sometimes the very richness and
      whimsicality of his bookish fancies marred the simplicity and good taste
      of his pages. But the fundamental texture of his thought and feeling <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span> was
      American, and his most characteristic style has the raciness of our soil.
      Nature lovers like to point out the freshness and delicacy of his reaction
      to the New England scene. Thoreau himself, whom Lowell did not like, was
      not more veracious an observer than the author of <i>Sunthin' in the
      Pastoral Line</i>, <i>Cambridge Thirty Years Ago</i>, and <i>My Garden
      Acquaintance</i>. Yet he watched men as keenly as he did "laylocks" and
      bobolinks, and no shrewder American essay has been written than his <i>On
      a Certain Condescension in Foreigners</i>. Wit and humor and wisdom made
      him one of the best talkers of his generation. These qualities pervade his
      essays and his letters, and the latter in particular reveal those ardors
      and fidelities of friendship which men like Emerson and Thoreau longed
      after without ever quite experiencing. Lowell's cosmopolitan reputation,
      which was greatly enhanced in the last decade of his life, seemed to his
      old associates of the Saturday Club only a fit recognition of the
      learning, wit, and fine imagination which had been familiar to them from
      the first. To hold the old friends throughout his lifetime, and to win
      fresh ones of a new generation through his books, is perhaps the greatest
      of Lowell's personal felicities.

      While there are no other names in the literature of New England quite
      comparable with those that have just been discussed, it should be
      remembered that the immediate effectiveness and popularity of these
      representative poets and prose writers were dependent upon the existence
      of an intelligent and responsive reading public. The lectures of Emerson,
      the speeches of Webster, the stories of Hawthorne, the political verse of
      Whittier and Lowell, presupposed a keen, reflecting audience, mentally and
      morally exigent. The spread of the Lyceum system along the line of
      westward emigration from New England as far as the Mississippi is one
      tangible evidence of the high level of popular intelligence. That there
      was much of the superficial and the spread-eagle in the American life of
      the eighteen-forties is apparent enough without the amusing comments of
      such English travellers as Dickens, Miss Martineau, and Captain Basil
      Hall. But there was also genuine intellectual curiosity and a general
      reading habit which are evidenced not only by a steady growth of
      newspapers and magazines but also by the demand for substantial books.
      Biography and history began to be widely read, and it was natural that the
      most notable productiveness in historical <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span> writing should manifest
      itself in that section of the country where there were libraries, wealth,
      leisure for the pursuits of scholarship, a sense of intimate concern with
      the great issues of the past, and a diffusion of intellectual tastes
      throughout the community. It was no accident that Sparks and Ticknor,
      Bancroft and Prescott, Motley and Parkman, were Massachusetts men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jared Sparks, it is true, inherited neither wealth nor leisure. He was a
      furious, unwearied toiler in the field of our national history. Born in
      1789, by profession a Unitarian minister, he began collecting the papers
      of George Washington by 1825. John Marshall, the great jurist, had
      published his five-volume life of his fellow Virginian a score of years
      earlier. But Sparks proceeded to write another biography of Washington and
      to edit his writings. He also edited a <i>Library of American Biography</i>,
      wrote lives of Franklin and Gouverneur Morris, was professor of history
      and President of Harvard, and lived to be seventy-seven. As editor of the
      writings of Franklin and Washington, he took what we now consider
      unpardonable liberties in altering the text, and this error of judgment
      has somewhat clouded his just reputation as a pioneer in historical
      research.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
      George Bancroft, who was born in 1800, and died, a horseback-riding sage,
      at ninety-one, inherited from his clergyman father a taste for history. He
      studied in Germany after leaving Harvard, turned schoolmaster, Democratic
      politician and office-holder, served as Secretary of the Navy, Minister to
      England and then to the German Empire, and won distinction in each of his
      avocations, though the real passion of his life was his <i>History of the
      United States</i>, which he succeeded in bringing down to the adoption of
      the Constitution. The first volume, which appeared in 1834, reads today
      like a stump speech by a sturdy Democratic orator of the Jacksonian
      period. But there was solid stuff in it, nevertheless, and as Bancroft
      proceeded, decade after decade, he discarded some of his rhetoric and
      philosophy of democracy and utilized increasingly the vast stores of
      documents which his energy and his high political positions had made it
      possible for him to obtain. Late in life he condensed his ten great
      volumes to six. Posterity will doubtless condense these in turn, as
      posterity has a way of doing, but Bancroft the historian realized his own
      youthful ambition with a completeness rare in the history of human effort
      and performed a monumental service to his country.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span> He
      was less of an artist, however, than Prescott, the eldest and in some ways
      the finest figure of the well-known Prescott-Motley-Parkman group of
      Boston historians. All of these men, together with their friend George
      Ticknor, who wrote the <i>History of Spanish Literature</i> and whose own
      <i>Life and Letters</i> pictures a whole generation, had the professional
      advantages of inherited wealth, and the opportunity to make deliberate
      choice of a historical field which offered freshness and picturesqueness
      of theme. All were tireless workers in spite of every physical handicap;
      all enjoyed social security and the rich reward of full recognition by
      their contemporaries. They had their world as in their time, as Chaucer
      makes the Wife of Bath say of herself, and it was a pleasant world to live
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandson of "Prescott the Brave" of Bunker Hill, and son of the rich Judge
      Prescott of Salem, William Hickling Prescott was born in 1796, and was
      graduated from Harvard in 1814. An accident in college destroyed the sight
      of one eye, and left him but a precarious use of the other. Nevertheless
      he resolved to emulate Gibbon, whose <i>Autobiography</i> had impressed
      him, and to make himself "an historian in the best sense of the term." He
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
      studied arduously in Europe, with the help of secretaries, and by 1826,
      after a long hesitation, decided upon a <i>History of the Reign of
      Ferdinand and Isabella</i>. In ten years the three volumes were finished.
      "Pursuing the work in this quiet, leisurely way, without over-exertion or
      fatigue," wrote Prescott, "or any sense of obligation to complete it in a
      given time, I have found it a continual source of pleasure." It was
      published at his own expense on Christmas Day, 1837, and met with
      instantaneous success. "My market and my reputation rest principally with
      England," he wrote in 1838&mdash;a curious footnote, by the way, to
      Emerson's Phi Beta Kappa Address of the year before. But America joined
      with England, in praising the new book. Then Prescott turned to the <i>Conquest
      of Mexico</i>, the <i>Conquest of Peru</i>, and finally to his unfinished
      <i>History of the Reign of Philip II</i>. He had, as Dean Milman wrote
      him, "the judgment to choose noble subjects." He wrote with serenity and
      dignity, with fine balance and proportion. Some of the Spanish documents
      upon which he relied have been proved less trustworthy than he thought,
      but this unsuspected defect in his materials scarcely impaired the skill
      with which this unhasting, unresting <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span> painter filled his great
      canvases. They need retouching, perhaps, but the younger historians are
      incompetent for the task. Prescott died in 1859, in the same year as
      Irving, and he already seems quite as remote from the present hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      His young friend Motley, of <i>Dutch Republic</i> fame, was another Boston
      Brahmin, born in the year of Prescott's graduation from college. He
      attended George Bancroft's school, went to Harvard in due course, where he
      knew Holmes, Sumner, and Wendell Phillips, and at G&ouml;ttingen became a
      warm friend of a dog-lover and duelist named Bismarck. Young Motley wrote
      a couple of unsuccessful novels, dabbled in diplomacy, politics, and
      review-writing, and finally, encouraged by Prescott, settled down upon
      Dutch history, went to Europe to work up his material in 1851, and, after
      five years, scored an immense triumph with his <i>Rise of the Dutch
      Republic</i>. He was a brilliant partisan, hating Spaniards and
      Calvinists, and wrote all the better for this bias. He was an admirable
      sketcher of historical portraits, and had Macaulay's skill in composing
      special chapters devoted to the tendencies and qualities of an epoch or to
      the characteristics of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181"
      id="Page_181">181</a></span> a dynasty. Between 1860 and 1868 he produced
      the four volumes of the <i>History of the United Netherlands</i>. During
      the Civil War he served usefully as American minister to Vienna, and in
      1869 was appointed minister to London. Both of these appointments ended
      unhappily for him. Dr. Holmes, his loyal admirer and biographer, does not
      conceal the fact that a steadier, less excitable type of public servant
      might have handled both the Vienna situation and the London situation
      without incurring a recall. Motley continued to live in England, where his
      daughters had married, and where, in spite of his ardent Americanism, he
      felt socially at home. His last book was <i>The Life and Death of John of
      Barneveld</i>. His <i>Letters</i>, edited after his death in 1877 by
      George William Curtis, give a fascinating picture of English life among
      the cultivated and leisurely classes. The Boston merchant's son was a
      high-hearted gentleman, and his cosmopolitan experiences used to make his
      stay-at-home friend, Oliver Wendell Holmes, feel rather dull and
      provincial in comparison. Both were Sons of Liberty, but Motley had had
      the luck to find in "brave little Holland" a subject which captivated the
      interest of Europe and gave the historian international fame. He <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span> had more
      eloquence than the Doctor, and a far more varied range of prose, but there
      may be here and there a Yankee guesser about the taste of future
      generations who will bet on <i>The Autocrat</i>, after all.

      The character and career of Francis Parkman afford curious material to the
      student of New England's golden age. In the seventy years of his heroic
      life, from 1823 to 1893, all the characteristic forces of the age reached
      their culmination and decline, and his own personality indicates some of
      the violent reactions produced by the over-strain of Transcendentalism.
      For here was a descendant of John Cotton, and a clergyman's son, who
      detested Puritanism and the clergy; who, coming to manhood in the
      eighteen-forties, hated the very words Transcendentalism, Philosophy,
      Religion, Reform; an inheritor of property, trained at Harvard, and an
      Overseer and Fellow of his University, who disliked the ideals of culture
      and refinement; a member of the Saturday Club who was bored with literary
      talk and literary people; a staunch American who despised democracy as
      thoroughly as Alexander Hamilton, and thought suffrage a failure; a
      nineteenth century historian who cared nothing for philosophy, science,
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span> or
      the larger lessons of history itself; a fascinating realistic writer who
      admired Scott, Byron, and Cooper for their tales of action, and despised
      Wordsworth and Thoreau as effeminate sentimentalists who were preoccupied
      with themselves. In Parkman "the wheel has come full circle," and a
      movement that began with expansion of self ended in hard Spartan
      repression, even in inhibition of emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Becoming "enamoured of the woods" at sixteen, Parkman chose his life work
      at eighteen, and he was a man who could say proudly: "I have not yet
      abandoned any plan which I ever formed." "Before the end of the sophomore
      year," he wrote in his autobiography, "my various schemes had crystallized
      into a plan of writing the story of what was then known as the <i>Old
      French War</i>, that is, the war that ended in the conquest of Canada, for
      here, as it seemed to me, the forest drama was more stirring and the
      forest stage more thronged with appropriate actors than in any other
      passage of our history. It was not till some years later that I enlarged
      the plan to include the whole course of the American conflict between
      France and England, or, in other words, the history of the American
      forest: for this <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
      was the light in which I regarded it. My theme fascinated me, and I was
      haunted with wilderness images day and night." To understand "the history
      of the American forest" young Parkman devoted his college vacations to
      long trips in the wilderness, and in 1846, two years after graduation, he
      made the epoch-making journey described in his first book, <i>The Oregon
      Trail</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The Conspiracy of Pontiac</i>, a highly-colored narrative in two
      volumes appearing in 1851, marks the first stage of his historical
      writing. Then came the tragedy of shattered health, and for fourteen years
      Parkman fought for life and sanity, and produced practically nothing. He
      had had to struggle from his college days with an obscure disorder of the
      brain, aggravated by the hardships of his Oregon Trail journey, and by
      ill-considered efforts to harden his bodily frame by over-exertion. His
      disease took many forms&mdash;insomnia, arthritis, weakness of sight,
      incapacity for sustained thought. His biographer Farnham says that "he
      never saw a perfectly well day during his entire literary career." Even
      when aided by secretaries and copyists, six lines a day was often the
      limit of his production. His own Stoic words about the limitations of his
      eyesight are <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
      characteristic: "By reading for one minute, and then resting for an equal
      time, this alternate process may gradually be continued for about half an
      hour. Then, after a sufficient interval, it may be repeated, often three
      or four times in the course of the day. By this means nearly the whole of
      the volume now offered has been composed." There is no more piteous or
      inspiring story of a fight against odds in the history of literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      For after his fortieth year the enemy gave way a little, and book after
      book somehow got itself written. There they stand upon the shelves, a
      dozen of them&mdash;<i>The Pioneers of France</i>, <i>The Jesuits in North
      America</i>, <i>La Salle</i>, <i>The Old R&eacute;gime</i>, <i>Frontenac</i>,
      <i>Montcalm and Wolfe</i>, <i>A Half-Century of Conflict</i>&mdash;the
      boy's dream realized, the man's long warfare accomplished. The history of
      the forest, as Parkman saw it, was a pageant with the dark wilderness for
      a background, and, for the actors, taciturn savages, black-robed Jesuits,
      intrepid explorers, soldiers of France&mdash;all struggling for a vast
      prize, all changing, passing, with a pomp and color unknown to wearied
      Europe. It was a superb theme, better after all for an American than the
      themes chosen by Prescott and Ticknor <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span> and Motley, and precisely
      adapted to the pictorial and narrative powers of the soldier-minded,
      soldier-hearted author.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quality which Parkman admired most in men&mdash;though he never seems
      to have loved men deeply, even his own heroes&mdash;was strength of will.
      That was the secret of his own power, and the sign, it must be added, of
      the limitations of this group of historians who came at the close of the
      golden age. Whatever a New England will can accomplish was wrought
      manfully by such admirable men as Prescott and Parkman. Trained
      intelligence, deliberate selection of subject, skillful cultivation of
      appropriate story-telling and picture-painting style, all these were
      theirs. But the "wild ecstasy" that thrilled the young Emerson as he
      crossed the bare Common at sunset, the "supernal beauty" of which Poe
      dreamed in the Fordham cottage, the bay horse and hound and turtle-dove
      which Thoreau lost long ago and could not find in his hut at Walden, these
      were something which our later Greeks of the New England Athens esteemed
      as foolishness.

      Poe and Whitman
    </p>
    <p class="noindent">
      <span class="smcap">Enter</span> now two egotists, who have little in
      common save their egotism, two outsiders who upset most of the
      conventional American rules for winning the literary race, two men of
      genius, in short, about whom we are still quarreling, and whose
      distinctive quality is more accurately perceived in Europe than it has
      ever been in the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Poe and Whitman were Romanticists by temperament. Both shared in the
      tradition and influence of European Romanticism. But they were also late
      comers, and they were caught in the more morbid and extravagant phases of
      the great European movement while its current was beginning to ebb. Their
      acquaintance with its literature was mainly at second-hand and through the
      medium of British and American periodicals. Poe, who was older than
      Whitman by ten years, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188"
      id="Page_188">188</a></span> was fifteen when Byron died, in 1824. He was
      untouched by the nobler mood of Byron, though his verse was colored by the
      influence of Byron, Moore, and Shelley. His prose models were De Quincey,
      Disraeli, and Bulwer. Yet he owed more to Coleridge than to any of the
      Romantics. He was himself a sort of Coleridge without the piety, with the
      same keen penetrating critical intelligence, the same lovely
      opium-shadowed dreams, and, alas, with something of the same reputation as
      a dead-beat.
    </p>
    <p>
      A child of strolling players, Poe happened to be born in Boston, but he
      hated "Frog-Pondium"&mdash;his favorite name for the city of his nativity&mdash;as
      much as Whistler hated his native town of Lowell. His father died early of
      tuberculosis, and his mother, after a pitiful struggle with disease and
      poverty, soon followed her husband to the grave. The boy, by physical
      inheritance a neurasthenic, though with marked bodily activity in youth,
      was adopted by the Allans, a kindly family in Richmond, Virginia. Poe
      liked to think of himself as a Southerner. He was sent to school in
      England, and in 1826, at seventeen, he attended for nearly a year the
      newly founded University of Virginia. He was a dark, short, bow-legged
      boy, with the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
      face of his own Roderick Usher. He made a good record in French and Latin,
      read, wrote and recited poetry, tramped on the Ragged Mountains, and did
      not notably exceed his companions in drinking and gambling. But his Scotch
      foster-father disapproved of his conduct and withdrew him from the
      University. A period of wandering followed. He enlisted in the army and
      was stationed in Boston in 1827, when his first volume, <i>Tamerlane</i>,
      was published. In 1829 he was in Fortress Monroe, and published <i>Al
      Aaraf</i> at Baltimore. He entered West Point in 1830, and was surely,
      except Whistler, the strangest of all possible cadets. When he was
      dismissed in 1831, he had written the marvellous lines <i>To Helen</i>, <i>Israfel</i>,
      and <i>The City in the Sea</i>. That is enough to have in one's knapsack
      at the age of twenty-two.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the eighteen years from 1831 to 1849, when Poe's unhappy life came to
      an end in a Baltimore hospital, his literary activity was chiefly that of
      a journalist, critic, and short story writer. He lived in Baltimore,
      Richmond, Philadelphia, and New York. Authors who now exploit their fat
      bargains with their publishers may have forgotten that letter which Poe
      wrote back to Philadelphia the morning after he arrived with his
      child-wife in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
      New York: "We are both in excellent spirits.&hellip; We have now got four
      dollars and a half left. To-morrow I am going to try and borrow three
      dollars, so that I may have a fortnight to go upon." When the child-wife
      died in the shabby cottage at Fordham, her wasted body was covered with
      the old army overcoat which Poe had brought from West Point. If Poe met
      some of the tests of practical life inadequately, it must be remembered
      that his health failed at twenty-five, that he was pitiably poor, and that
      the slightest indulgence in drink set his over-wrought nerves jangling.
      Ferguson, the former office-boy of the <i>Literary Messenger</i>, judged
      this man of letters with an office-boy's firm and experienced eye: "Mr.
      Poe was a fine gentleman when he was sober. He was ever kind and courtly,
      and at such times everyone liked him. But when he was drinking he was
      about one of the most disagreeable men I have ever met." "I am sorry for
      him," wrote C.&nbsp;F. Briggs to Lowell. "He has some good points, but
      taken altogether, he is badly made up." "Badly made up," no doubt, both in
      body and mind, but all respectable and prosperous Pharisees should be
      reminded that Poe did not make himself; or rather, that he could not make
      himself <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
      over. Very few men can. Given Poe's temperament, and the problem is
      insoluble. He wrote to Lowell in 1844: "I have been too deeply conscious
      of the mutability and evanescence of temporal things to give any
      continuous effort to anything&mdash;to be consistent in anything. My life
      has been <i>whim</i>&mdash;impulse&mdash;passion&mdash;a longing for
      solitude&mdash;a scorn of all things present in an earnest desire for the
      future." It is the pathetic confession of a dreamer. Yet this dreamer was
      also a keen analyzer, a tireless creator of beautiful things. In them he
      sought and found a refuge from actuality. The marvel of his career is, as
      I have said elsewhere, that this solitary, embittered craftsman, out of
      such hopeless material as negations and abstractions, shadows and
      superstitions, out of disordered fancies and dreams of physical horror and
      strange crime, should have wrought structures of imperishable beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us notice the critical instinct which he brought to the task of
      creation. His theory of verse is simple, in fact too simple to account for
      all of the facts. The aim of poetry, according to Poe, is not truth but
      pleasure&mdash;the rhythmical creation of beauty. Poetry should be brief,
      indefinite, and musical. Its chief instrument is sound. <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span> A certain
      quaintness or grotesqueness of tone is a means for satisfying the thirst
      for supernal beauty. Hence the musical lyric is to Poe the only true type
      of poetry; a long poem does not exist. Readers who respond more readily to
      auditory than to visual or motor stimulus are therefore Poe's chosen
      audience. For them he executes, like Paganini, marvels upon his single
      string. He has easily recognizable devices: the dominant note, the
      refrain, the "repetend," that is to say the phrase which echoes, with some
      variation, a phrase or line already used. In such poems as <i>To Helen</i>,
      <i>Israfel</i>, <i>The Haunted Palace</i>, <i>Annabel Lee</i>, the theme,
      the tone, the melody all weave their magic spell; it is like listening to
      a lute-player in a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the device often turns into a trick is equally true. In <i>The Bells</i>
      and <i>The Raven</i> we detect the prestidigitator. It is jugglery, though
      such juggling as only a master-musician can perform. In <i>Ulalume</i> and
      other show-pieces the wires get crossed and the charm snaps, scattering
      tinsel fragments of nonsense verse. Such are the dangers of the technical
      temperament unenriched by wide and deep contact with human feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poe's theory of the art of the short story is <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span> now familiar enough. The
      power of a tale, he thought, turned chiefly if not solely upon its unity,
      its harmony of effect. This is illustrated in all of his finest stories.
      In <i>The Fall of the House of Usher</i> the theme is Fear; the opening
      sentence strikes the key and the closing sentence contains the climax. In
      the whole composition every sentence is modulated to the one end in view.
      The autumn landscape tones with the melancholy house; the somber chamber
      frames the cadaverous face of Roderick Usher; the face is an index of the
      tumultuous agitation of a mind wrestling with the grim phantom Fear and
      awaiting the cumulative horror of the final moment. In <i>Ligeia</i>,
      which Poe sometimes thought the best of all his tales, the theme is the
      ceaseless life of the will, the potency of the spirit of the beloved and
      departed woman. The unity of effect is absolute, the workmanship
      consummate. So with the theme of revenge in <i>The Cask of Amontillado</i>,
      the theme of mysterious intrigue in <i>The Assignation</i>. In Poe's
      detective stories, or tales of ratiocination as he preferred to call them,
      he takes to pieces for our amusement a puzzle which he has cunningly put
      together. <i>The Gold Bug</i> is the best known of these, <i>The Purloined
      Letter</i> the most perfect, <i>The</i> <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span> <i>Murders in the Rue Morgue</i>
      the most sensational. Then there are the tales upon scientific subjects or
      displaying the pretence of scientific knowledge, where the narrator loves
      to pose as a man without imagination and with "habits of rigid thought."
      And there are tales of conscience, of which <i>The Black Cat</i> is the
      most fearful and <i>William Wilson</i> the most subtle; and there are
      landscape sketches and fantasies and extravaganzas, most of these poor
      stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is ungrateful and perhaps unnecessary to dwell upon Poe's limitations.
      His scornful glance caught certain aspects of the human drama with
      camera-like precision. Other aspects of life, and nobler, he never seemed
      to perceive. The human comedy sometimes moved him to laughter, but his
      humor is impish and his wit malign. His imagination fled from the
      daylight; he dwelt in the twilight among the tombs. He closed his eyes to
      dream, and could not see the green sunlit earth, seed-time and harvest,
      man going forth to his toil and returning to his hearthstone, the America
      that laughs as it labors. He wore upon his finger the magic ring and the
      genii did his bidding. But we could wish that the palaces they reared for
      him were not in such a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195"
      id="Page_195">195</a></span> somber land, with such infernal lights
      gleaming in their windows, and crowded with such horror-haunted forms. We
      could wish that his imagination dealt less often with those primitive
      terrors that belong to the childhood of our race. Yet when his spell is
      upon us we lapse back by a sort of atavism into primal savagery and
      shudder with a recrudescence of long forgotten fears. No doubt Poe was
      ignorant of life, in the highest sense. He was caged in by his ignorance,
      Yet he had beautiful dusky wings that bruised themselves against his
      prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poe was a tireless critic of his own work, and both his standards of
      workmanship and his critical precepts have been of great service to his
      careless countrymen. He turned out between four and five short stories a
      year, was poorly paid for them, and indeed found difficulty in selling
      them at all. Yet he was constantly correcting them for the better. His
      best poems were likewise his latest. He was tantalized with the desire for
      artistic perfection. He became the pathbreaker for a long file of men in
      France, Italy, England, and America. He found the way and they brought
      back the glory and the cash.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have sometimes imagined Poe, with four other <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span> men and one woman, seated at
      a dinner-table laid for six, and talking of their art and of themselves.
      What would the others think of Poe? I fancy that Thackeray would chat with
      him courteously, but would not greatly care for him. George Eliot,
      woman-like, would pity him. Hawthorne would watch him with those
      inscrutable eyes and understand him better than the rest. But Stevenson
      would be immensely interested; he would begin an essay on Poe before he
      went to sleep. And Mr. Kipling would look sharply at him: he has seen that
      man before, in <i>The Gate of a Hundred Sorrows</i>. All of them would
      find in him something to praise, a great deal to marvel at, and perhaps
      not much to love. And the sensitive, shabby, lonely Poe&mdash;what would
      he think of them? He might not care much for the other guests, but I think
      he would say to himself with a thrill of pride: "I belong at this table."
      And he does.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walt Whitman, whom his friend O'Connor dubbed the "good gray poet," offers
      a bizarre contrast to Edgar Allan Poe. There was nothing distinctively
      American about Poe except his ingenuity; he had no interest in American
      history or in American ideas; he was a timeless, placeless embodiment of
      technical artistry. But Whitman <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197"
      id="Page_197">197</a></span> had a passion for his native soil; he was
      hypnotized by the word America; he spent much of his mature life in
      brooding over the question, "What, after all, is an American, and what
      should an American poet be in our age of science and democracy?" It is
      true that he was as untypical as Poe of the average citizen of "these
      states." His personality is unique. In many respects he still baffles our
      curiosity. He repels many of his countrymen without arousing the pity
      which adds to their romantic interest in Poe. Whatever our literary
      students may feel, and whatever foreign critics may assert, it must be
      acknowledged that to the vast majority of American men and women "good old
      Walt" is still an outsider.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us try to see first the type of mind with which we are dealing. It is
      fundamentally religious, perceiving the unity and kinship and glory of all
      created things. It is this passion of worship which inspired St. Francis
      of Assisi's <i>Canticle to the Sun</i>. It cries, "Benedicite, Omnia opera
      Domini: All ye Green Things upon the Earth, bless ye the Lord!" That is
      the real motto for Whitman's <i>Leaves of Grass</i>. Like St. Francis, and
      like his own immediate master, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Whitman is a mystic.
      He cannot argue the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
      ultimate questions; he asserts them. Instead of marshaling and sifting the
      proofs for immortality, he chants "I know I am deathless." Like Emerson
      again, Whitman shares that peculiarly American type of mysticism known as
      Transcendentalism, but he came at the end of this movement instead of at
      the beginning of it. In his Romanticism, likewise, he is an end of an era
      figure. His affiliations with Victor Hugo are significant; and a volume of
      Scott's poems which he owned at the age of sixteen became his
      "inexhaustible mine and treasury for more than sixty years." Finally, and
      quite as uncompromisingly as Emerson, Thoreau, and Poe, Whitman is an
      individualist. He represents the assertive, Jacksonian period of our
      national existence. In a thousand similes he makes a declaration of
      independence for the separate person, the "single man" of Emerson's Phi
      Beta Kappa address. "I wear my hat as I please, indoors and out."
      Sometimes this is mere swagger. Sometimes it is superb.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for the type. Let us turn next to the story of Whitman's life. It
      must here be told in the briefest fashion, for Whitman's own prose and
      poetry relate the essentials of his biography. He was born on Long Island,
      of New England and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
      Dutch ancestry, in 1819. Lowell, W.&nbsp;W. Story, and Charles A. Dana
      were born in that year, as was also George Eliot. Whitman's father was a
      carpenter, who "leaned to the Quakers." There were many children. When
      little "Walt"&mdash;as he was called, to distinguish him from his father,
      Walter&mdash;was four, the family moved to Brooklyn. The boy had scanty
      schooling, and by the time he was twenty had tried type-setting, teaching,
      and editing a country newspaper on Long Island. He was a big, dark-haired
      fellow, sensitive, emotional, extraordinarily impressible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next sixteen years were full of happy vagrancy. At twenty-two he was
      editing a paper in New York, and furnishing short stories to the <i>Democratic
      Review</i>, a literary journal which numbered Bryant, Longfellow,
      Whittier, Poe, Hawthorne, and Thoreau among its contributors. He wrote a
      novel on temperance, "mostly in the reading-room of Tammany Hall," and
      tried here and there an experiment in free verse. He was in love with the
      pavements of New York and the Brooklyn ferry-boats, in love with Italian
      opera and with long tramps over Long Island. He left his position on <i>The
      Brooklyn Eagle</i> and wandered south to New Orleans. By and by he drifted
      back <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
      to New York, tried lecturing, worked at the carpenter's trade with his
      father, and brooded over a book&mdash;"a book of new things."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the famous <i>Leaves of Grass</i>. He set the type himself, in a
      Brooklyn printing-office, and printed about eight hundred copies. The book
      had a portrait of the author&mdash;a meditative, gray-bearded poet in
      workman's clothes&mdash;and a confused preface on America as a field for
      the true poet. Then followed the new gospel, "I celebrate myself," chanted
      in long lines of free verse, whose patterns perplexed contemporary
      readers. For the most part it was passionate speech rather than song, a
      rhapsodical declamation in hybrid rhythms. Very few people bought the book
      or pretended to understand what it was all about. Some were startled by
      the frank sexuality of certain poems. But Emerson wrote to Whitman from
      Concord: "I find it the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that
      America has yet contributed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Until the Civil War was half over, Whitman remained in Brooklyn, patiently
      composing new poems for successive printings of his book. Then he went to
      the front to care for a wounded brother, and finally settled down in a
      Washington garret <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
      to spend his strength as an army hospital nurse. He wrote <i>Drum Taps</i>
      and other magnificent poems about the War, culminating in his threnody on
      Lincoln's death, <i>When Lilacs last in the Dooryard Bloomed</i>.
      Swinburne called this "the most sonorous nocturn ever chanted in the
      church of the world." After the war had ended, Whitman stayed on in
      Washington as a government clerk, and saw much of John Burroughs and W.&nbsp;D.
      O'Connor. John Hay was a staunch friend. Some of the best known poets and
      critics of England and the Continent now began to recognize his genius.
      But his health had been permanently shattered by his heroic service as a
      nurse, and in 1873 he suffered a paralytic stroke which forced him to
      resign his position in Washington and remove to his brother's home in
      Camden, New Jersey.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was only fifty-four, but his best work was already done, and his
      remaining years, until his death in 1892, were those of patient and serene
      invalidism. He wrote some fascinating prose in this final period, and his
      cluttered chamber in Camden became the shrine of many a literary pilgrim,
      among them some of the foremost men of letters of this country and of
      Europe. He was <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
      cared for by loyal friends. Occasionally he appeared in public, a
      magnificent gray figure of a man. And then, at seventy-three, the "Dark
      mother always gliding near" enfolded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are puzzling things in the physical and moral constitution of Walt
      Whitman, and the obstinate questions involved in his theory of poetry and
      in his actual poetical performance are still far from solution. But a few
      points concerning him are by this time fairly clear. They must be swiftly
      summarized.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first obstacle to the popular acceptance of Walt Whitman is the
      formlessness or alleged formlessness of <i>Leaves of Grass</i>. This is a
      highly technical question, involving a more accurate notation than has
      thus far been made of the patterns and tunes of free verse and of
      emotional prose. Whitman's "new and national declamatory expression," as
      he termed it, cannot receive a final technical valuation until we have
      made more scientific progress in the analysis of rhythms. As regards the
      contents of his verse, it is plain that he included much material unfused
      and untransformed by emotion. These elements foreign to the nature of
      poetry clog many of his lines. The enumerated objects in his catalogue or
      inventory <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
      poems often remain inert objects only. Like many mystics, he was
      hypnotized by external phenomena, and he often fails to communicate to his
      reader the trance-like emotion which he himself experienced. This
      imperfect transfusion of his material is a far more significant defect in
      Whitman's poetry than the relatively few passages of unashamed sexuality
      which shocked the American public in 1855.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gospel or burden of <i>Leaves of Grass</i> is no more difficult of
      comprehension than the general drift of Emerson's essays, which helped to
      inspire it. The starting-point of the book is a mystical illumination
      regarding the unity and blessedness of the universe, an insight passing
      understanding, but based upon the revelatory experience of love. In the
      light of this experience, all created things are recognized as divine. The
      starting-point and center of the Whitman world is the individual man, the
      "strong person," imperturbable in mind, athletic in body, unconquerable,
      and immortal. Such individuals meet in comradeship, and pass together
      along the open roads of the world. No one is excluded because of his
      poverty or his sins; there is room in the ideal America for everybody
      except the doubter and sceptic. Whitman does <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span> not linger over the smaller
      groups of human society, like the family. He is not a fireside poet. He
      passes directly from his strong persons, meeting freely on the open road,
      to his conception of "these States." One of his typical visions of the
      breadth and depth and height of America will be found in <i>By Blue
      Ontario's Shore</i>. In this and in many similar rhapsodies Whitman holds
      obstinately to what may be termed the three points of his national creed.
      The first is the newness of America, and its expression is in his
      well-known chant of <i>Pioneers, O Pioneers</i>. Yet this new America is
      subtly related to the past; and in Whitman's later poems, such as <i>Passage
      to India</i>, the spiritual kinship of orient and occident is emphasized.
      The second article of the creed is the unity of America. Here he voices
      the conceptions of Hamilton, Clay, Webster, and Lincoln. In spite of all
      diversity in external aspects the republic is "one and indivisible." This
      unity, in Whitman's view, was cemented forever by the issue of the Civil
      War. Lincoln, the "Captain," dies indeed on the deck of the "victor ship,"
      but the ship comes into the harbor "with object won." Third and finally,
      Whitman insists upon the solidarity of America with all countries of the
      globe. Particularly in his <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205"
      id="Page_205">205</a></span> yearning and thoughtful old age, the poet
      perceived that humanity has but one heart and that it should have but one
      will. No American poet has ever prophesied so directly and powerfully
      concerning the final issue involved in that World War which he did not
      live to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whitman, like Poe, had defects of character and defects of art. His life
      and work raise many problems which will long continue to fascinate and to
      baffle the critics. But after all of them have had their say, it will
      remain true that he was a seer and a prophet, far in advance of his own
      time, like Lincoln, and like Lincoln, an inspired interpreter of the soul
      of this republic.

    <p class="noindent">
      "<span class="smcap">There</span> is what I call the American idea,"
      declared Theodore Parker in the Anti-Slavery Convention of 1850. "This
      idea demands, as the proximate organization thereof, a democracy&mdash;that
      is, a government of all the people, by all the people, for all the people;
      of course, a government on the principle of eternal justice, the
      unchanging law of God; for shortness' sake, I will call it the idea of
      Freedom."
    </p>
    <p>
      These are noble words, and they are thought to have suggested a familiar
      phrase of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, thirteen years later. Yet students
      of literature, no less than students of politics, recognize the difficulty
      of summarizing in words a national "idea." Precisely what was the Greek
      "idea"? What is today the French "idea"? No single formula is adequate to
      express such a complex of fact, theories, moods&mdash;not even <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span> the famous
      "Liberty, Fraternity, Equality." The existence of a truly national life
      and literature presupposes a certain degree of unity, an integration of
      race, language, political institutions, and social ideals. It is obvious
      that this problem of national integration meets peculiar obstacles in the
      United States. Divergencies of race, tradition, and social theory, and
      clashing interests of different sections have been felt from the beginning
      of the nation's life. There was well-nigh complete solidarity in the
      single province of New England during a portion of the seventeenth
      century, and under the leadership of the great Virginians there was
      sufficient national fusion to make the Revolution successful. But early in
      the nineteenth century, the opening of the new West, and the increasing
      economic importance of Slavery as a peculiar institution of the South,
      provoked again the ominous question of the possibility of an enduring
      Union. From 1820 until the end of the Civil War, it was the chief
      political issue of the United States. The aim of the present chapter is to
      show how the theme of Union and Liberty affected our literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      To appreciate the significance of this theme we must remind ourselves
      again of what many persons <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208"
      id="Page_208">208</a></span> have called the civic note in our national
      writing. Franklin exemplified it in his day. It is far removed from the
      pure literary art of a Poe, a Hawthorne, a Henry James. It aims at action
      rather than beauty. It seeks to persuade, to convince, to bring things to
      pass. We shall observe it in the oratory of Clay and Webster, as they
      pleaded for compromise; in the editorials of Garrison, a foe to compromise
      and like Calhoun an advocate, if necessary, of disunion; in the
      epoch-making novel of Harriet Beecher Stowe; in the speeches of Wendell
      Phillips, in verse white-hot with political passion, and sermons blazing
      with the fury of attack and defense of principles dear to the human heart.
      We must glance, at least, at the lyrics produced by the war itself, and
      finally, we shall observe how Abraham Lincoln, the inheritor of the ideas
      of Jefferson, Clay, and Webster, perceives and maintains, in the noblest
      tones of our civic speech, the sole conditions of our continuance as a
      nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us begin with oratory, an American habit, and, as many besides Dickens
      have thought, an American defect. We cannot argue that question adequately
      here. It is sufficient to say that in the pioneer stages of our existence
      oratory was necessary <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209"
      id="Page_209">209</a></span> as a stimulus to communal thought and
      feeling. The speeches of Patrick Henry and Samuel Adams were as essential
      to our winning independence as the sessions of statesmen and the armed
      conflicts in the field. And in that new West which came so swiftly and
      dramatically into existence at the close of the Revolution, the orator
      came to be regarded as the normal type of intellectual leadership. The
      stump grew more potent than schoolhouse and church and bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very pattern, and, if one likes, the tragic victim of this
      glorification of oratory was Henry Clay, "Harry of the West," the glamour
      of whose name and the wonderful tones of whose voice became for a while a
      part of the political system of the United States. Union and Liberty were
      the master-passions of Clay's life, but the greater of these was Union.
      The half-educated young immigrant from Virginia hazarded his career at the
      outset by championing Anti-Slavery in the Kentucky Constitutional
      Convention; the last notable act of his life was his successful
      management, at the age of seventy-three, of the futile Compromise of 1850.
      All his life long he fought for national issues; for the War of 1812, for
      a protective tariff and an "American system," for the Missouri <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span> Compromise
      of 1820 as a measure for national safety; and he had plead generously for
      the young South American republics and for struggling Greece. He had
      become the perpetual candidate of his party for the Presidency, and had
      gone down again and again in unforeseen and heart-rending defeat. Yet he
      could say honorably: "If any one desires to know the leading and paramount
      object of my public life, the preservation of this union will furnish him
      the key." One could wish that the speeches of this fascinating American
      were more readable today. They seem thin, facile, full of phrases&mdash;such
      adroit phrases as would catch the ear of a listening, applauding audience.
      Straight, hard thinking was not the road to political preferment in Clay's
      day. Calhoun had that power, as Lincoln had it. Webster had the capacity
      for it, although he was too indolent to employ his great gifts steadily.
      Yet it was Webster who analyzed kindly and a little sadly, for he was
      talking during Clay's last illness and just before his own, his old
      rival's defect in literary quality: "He was never a man of books.&hellip;
      I could never imagine him sitting comfortably in his library and reading
      quietly out of the great books of the past. He has been too fond of
      excitement&mdash;he has lived upon it; <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span> he has been too fond of
      company, not enough alone; and has had few resources within himself." Were
      the limitations of a typical oratorical temperament ever touched more
      unerringly than in these words?
    </p>
    <p>
      When Webster himself thundered, at the close of his reply to Hayne in
      1830, "Union <em>and</em> Liberty, now and forever, one and inseparable,"
      the words sank deeper into the consciousness of the American people than
      any similar sentiment uttered by Henry Clay. For Webster's was the richer,
      fuller nature, nurtured by "the great books of the past," brooding, as
      Lincoln was to brood later, over the seemingly insoluble problem of
      preserving a union of States half slave, half free. On the fateful seventh
      of March, 1850, Webster, like Clay, cast the immense weight of his
      personality and prestige upon the side of compromise. It was the ruin of
      his political fortune, for the mood of the North was changing, and the
      South preferred other candidates for the Presidency. Yet the worst that
      can fairly be said against that speech today is that it lacked moral
      imagination to visualize, as Mrs. Stowe was soon to visualize, the human
      results of slavery. As a plea for the transcendent necessity of
      maintaining the old Union it was consistent <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span> with Webster's whole
      development of political thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      What were the secrets of that power that held Webster's hearers literally
      spellbound, and made the North think of him, after that alienation of
      1850, as a fallen angel? No one can say fully, for we touch here the
      mysteries of personality and of the spoken word. But enough survives from
      the Webster legend, from his correspondence and political and legal
      oratory, to bring us into the presence of a superman. The dark Titan face,
      painted by such masters as Carlyle, Hawthorne, and Emerson; the magical
      voice, remembered now but by a few old men; the bodily presence, with its
      leonine suggestion of sleepy power only half put forth&mdash;these aided
      Webster to awe men or allure them into personal idolatry. Yet outside of
      New England he was admired rather than loved. There is still universal
      recognition of the mental capacity of this foremost lawyer and foremost
      statesman of his time. He was unsurpassed in his skill for direct, simple,
      limpid statement; but he could rise at will to a high Roman stateliness of
      diction, a splendid sonorousness of cadence. His greatest public
      appearances were in the Dartmouth College Case before the Supreme Court,
      the Plymouth, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
      Bunker Hill, and Adams-Jefferson commemorative orations, the Reply to
      Hayne, and the Seventh of March speeches in the Senate. Though he
      exhibited in his private life something of the prodigal recklessness of
      the pioneer, his mental operations were conservative, constructive. His
      lifelong antagonist Calhoun declared that "The United States are not a
      nation." Webster, in opposition to this theory of a confederation of
      states, devoted his superb talents to the demonstration of the thesis that
      the United States "<em>is</em>," not "are." Thus he came to be known as
      the typical expounder of the Constitution. When he reached, in 1850, the
      turning-point of his career, his countrymen knew by heart his personal and
      political history, the New Hampshire boyhood and education, the rise to
      mastery at the New England bar, the service in the House of
      Representatives and the Senate and as Secretary of State. His speeches
      were already in the schoolbooks, and for twenty years boys had been
      declaiming his arguments against nullification. He had helped to teach
      America to think and to feel. Indeed it was through his oratory that many
      of his fellow-citizens had gained their highest conception of the beauty,
      the potency, and the dignity of human <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span> speech. And in truth he never
      exhibited his logical power and demonstrative skill more superbly than in
      the plea of the seventh of March for the preservation of the <i>status quo</i>,
      for the avoidance of mutual recrimination between North and South, for
      obedience to the law of the land. It was his supreme effort to reconcile
      an irreconcilable situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It failed, as we know. Whittier, Emerson, Theodore Parker, and indeed most
      of the voters of New England, believed that Webster had bartered his
      private convictions in the hope of securing the Presidential nomination in
      1852. They assailed him savagely, and Webster died, a broken man, in the
      autumn of the Presidential year. "I have given my life to law and
      politics," he wrote to Professor Silliman. "Law is uncertain and politics
      are utterly vain." The dispassionate judgment of the present hour frees
      him from the charge of conscious treachery to principle. He was rather a
      martyr to his own conception of the obligations imposed by nationality.
      When these obligations run counter to human realities, the theories of
      statesmen must give way. Emerson could not refute that logic of Webster's
      argument for the Fugitive Slave Law, but he could at least record <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span> in his
      private <i>Journal</i>: "<em>I will not obey it, by God!</em>" So said
      hundreds of thousands of obscure men in the North, but Webster did not or
      could not hear them.
    </p>
    <p>
      While no other orator of that period was so richly endowed as Daniel
      Webster, the struggle for Union and Liberty enlisted on both sides many
      eloquent men. John C. Calhoun's acute, ingenious, masterly political
      theorizing can still be studied in speeches that have lost little of their
      effectiveness through the lapse of time. The years have dealt roughly with
      Edward Everett, once thought to be the pattern of oratorical gifts and
      graces. In commemorative oratory, indeed, he ranked with Webster, but the
      dust is settling upon his learned and ornate pages. Rufus Choate, another
      conservative Whig in politics, and a leader, like Wirt and Pinkney, at the
      bar, had an exotic, almost Oriental fancy, a gorgeousness of diction, and
      an intensity of emotion unrivaled among his contemporaries. His Dartmouth
      College eulogy of Webster in 1853 shows him at his best. The Anti-Slavery
      orators, on the other hand, had the advantage of a specific moral issue in
      which they led the attack. Wendell Phillips was the most polished, the
      most consummate in his air of informality, <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span> and his example did much to
      puncture the American tradition of high-flown oratory. He was an expert in
      virulent denunciation, passionately unfair beneath his mask of
      conversational decorum, an aristocratic demagogue. He is still distrusted
      and hated by the Brahmin class of his own city, still adored by the
      children and grandchildren of slaves. Charles Sumner, like Edward Everett,
      seems sinking into popular oblivion, in spite of the statues and portraits
      and massive volumes of erudite and caustic and high-minded orations. He
      may be seen at his best in such books as Longfellow's <i>Journal and
      Correspondence</i> and the <i>Life and Letters</i> of George Ticknor.
      There one has a pleasant picture of a booklover, traveler, and friend. But
      in his public speech he was arrogant, unsympathetic, domineering. "Sumner
      is my idea of a bishop," said Lincoln tentatively. There are bishops and
      bishops, however, and if Henry Ward Beecher, whom Lincoln and hosts of
      other Americans admired, had only belonged to the Church of England, what
      an admirable Victorian bishop he might have made! Perhaps his best service
      to the cause of union was rendered by his speeches in England, where he
      fairly mobbed the mob and won them by his wit, courage, and by <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span> his appeal
      to the instinct of fair play. Beecher's oratory, in and out of the pulpit,
      was temperamental, sentimental in the better sense, and admirably human in
      all its instincts. He had an immense following, not only in political and
      humanitarian fields, but as a lovable type of the everyday American who
      can say undisputed things not only solemnly, if need be, but by preference
      with an infectious smile. The people who loved Mr. Beecher are the people
      who understand Mr. Bryan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foremost among the journalists of the great debate were William Lloyd
      Garrison and Horace Greeley. Garrison was a perfect example of the
      successful journalist as described by Zola&mdash;the man who keeps on
      pounding at a single idea until he has driven it into the head of the
      public. Everyone knows at least the sentence from his salutatory editorial
      in <i>The Liberator</i> on January 1, 1831: "I am in earnest&mdash;I will
      not retreat a single inch&mdash;<i>And I will be heard</i>." He kept this
      vow, and he also kept the accompanying and highly characteristic promise:
      "I will be as harsh as truth and as uncompromising as justice. On this
      subject, I do not wish to think, or write, or speak, with moderation." But
      there would be little political literature <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span> in the world if its
      production were entrusted to the moderate type of man, and the files of <i>The
      Liberator</i>, though certainly harsh and full of all uncharitableness
      towards slave-owners, make excellent reading for the twentieth century
      American who perceives that in spite of the triumph of emancipation, in
      which Garrison had his fair share of glory, many aspects of our
      race-problem remain unsolved. Horace Greeley, the founder and editor of
      the <i>New York Tribune</i>, was a farmer's boy who learned early to speak
      and write the vocabulary of the plain people. Always interested in new
      ideas, even in Transcendentalism and Fourierism, his courage and energy
      and journalistic vigor gave him leadership in the later phases of the
      movement for enfranchisement. He did not hesitate to offer unasked advice
      to Lincoln on many occasions, and Lincoln enriched our literature by his
      replies. Greeley had his share of faults and fatuities, but in his best
      days he had an impressively loyal following among both rural and city-bred
      readers of his paper, and he remains one of the best examples of that
      obsolescent personal journalism which is destined to disappear under
      modern conditions of newspaper production. Readers really used to care for
      "what Greeley said" and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219"
      id="Page_219">219</a></span> "Dana said" and "Sam Bowles said," and all of
      these men, with scores of others, have left their stamp upon the phrases
      and the tone of our political writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the concrete issue of Slavery, however, it must be admitted that the
      most remarkable literary victory was scored, not by any orator or
      journalist, but by an almost unknown little woman, the author of <i>Uncle
      Tom's Cabin</i>. No American novel has had so curious a history and so
      great or so immediate an influence in this country and in Europe. In spite
      of all that has been written about it, its author's purpose is still
      widely misunderstood, particularly in the South, and the controversy over
      this one epoch-making novel has tended to obscure the literary reputation
      which Mrs. Stowe won by her other books.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harriet Beecher, the daughter and the sister of famous clergymen, was born
      in Litchfield, Connecticut, in 1811. For seventeen years, from 1832 to
      1849, she lived in the border city of Cincinnati, within sight of slave
      territory, and in daily contact with victims of the slave system. While
      her sympathies, like those of her father Lyman Beecher, were anti-slavery,
      she was not an Abolitionist in the Garrisonian sense of that word. At
      twenty-five <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
      she had married a widowed professor, Calvin Stowe, to whom she bore many
      children. She had written a few sketches of New England life, and her
      family thought her a woman of genius. Such was the situation in the winter
      of 1849-1850, when the Stowes migrated to Brunswick, Maine, where the
      husband had been appointed to a chair at Bowdoin. Pitiably poor, and
      distracted by household cares which she had to face single-handed&mdash;for
      the Professor was a "feckless body"&mdash;Mrs. Stowe nevertheless could
      not be indifferent to the national crisis over the Fugitive Slave Law. She
      had seen its working. When her sister-in-law wrote to her: "If I could use
      a pen as you can, I would write something that would make this whole
      nation feel what an accursed thing slavery is," Mrs. Stowe exclaimed: "God
      helping me, I will write something; I will if I live."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>, begun in the spring of 1850, was a woman's
      answer to Webster's seventh of March speech. Its object was plainly stated
      to be "to awaken sympathy and feeling for the African race; to show, their
      wrongs and sorrows, under a system so necessarily cruel and unjust as to
      defeat and do away the good effects of all that can be attempted for them,
      by their best friends under <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221"
      id="Page_221">221</a></span> it." The book was permeated with what we now
      call the 1848 anti-aristocratic sentiment, the direct heritage of the
      French Revolution. "There is a <i>dies ir&oelig;</i> coming on, sooner or
      later," admits St. Clare in the story. "The same thing is working, in
      Europe, in England, and in this country." There was no sectional hostility
      in Mrs. Stowe's heart. "The people of the free states have defended,
      encouraged, and participated [in slavery]; and are more guilty for it,
      before God, than the South, in that they have <em>not</em> the apology of
      education or custom. If the mothers of the free states had all felt as
      they should in times past, the sons of the free states would not have been
      the holders, and proverbially the hardest masters, of slaves; the sons of
      the free states would not have connived at the extension of slavery in our
      national body." "Your book is going to be the great pacificator," wrote a
      friend of Mrs. Stowe; "it will unite North and South." But the distinctly
      Christian and fraternal intention of the book was swiftly forgotten in the
      storm of controversy that followed its appearance. It had been written
      hastily, fervidly, in the intervals of domestic toil at Brunswick, had
      been printed as a serial in <i>The National Era</i> without attracting
      much attention, and was <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222"
      id="Page_222">222</a></span> issued in book form in March, 1852. Its
      sudden and amazing success was not confined to this country. The story ran
      in three Paris newspapers at once, was promptly dramatized, and has held
      the stage in France ever since. It was placed upon the <i>Index</i> in
      Italy, as being subversive of established authority. Millions of copies
      were sold in Europe, and <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>, more than any other
      cause, held the English working men in sympathy with the North in the
      English cotton crisis of our Civil War.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is easy to see the faults of this masterpiece and impossible not to
      recognize its excellencies. "If our art has not scope enough to include a
      book of this kind," said Madame George Sand, "we had better stretch the
      terms of our art a little." For the book proved to be, as its author had
      hoped, a "living dramatic reality." Topsy, Chloe, Sam and Andy, Miss
      Ophelia and Legree are alive. Mrs. St. Clare might have been one of
      Balzac's indolent, sensuous women. Uncle Tom himself is a bit too good to
      be true, and readers no longer weep over the death of little Eva&mdash;nor,
      for that matter, over the death of Dickens's little Nell. There is some
      melodrama, some religiosity, and there are some absurd recognition scenes
      at the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
      close. Nevertheless with an instinctive genius which Zola would have
      envied, Mrs. Stowe embodies in men and women the vast and ominous system
      of slavery. All the tragic forces of necessity, blindness, sacrifice, and
      retribution are here: neither Shelby, nor Eliza, nor the tall Kentuckian
      who aids her, nor John Bird, nor Uncle Tom himself in the final act of his
      drama, can help himself. For good or evil they are the products and
      results of the system; and yet they have and they give the illusion of
      volition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Stowe lived to write many another novel and short story, among them
      <i>Dred</i>, <i>The Minister's Wooing</i>, <i>Oldtown Folks</i>, <i>Oldtown
      Fireside Stories</i>. In the local short story she deserves the honors due
      to one of the pioneers, and her keen affectionate observation, her humor,
      and her humanity, would have given her a literary reputation quite
      independent of her masterpiece. But she is likely to pay the penalty of
      that astounding success, and to go down to posterity as the author of a
      single book. She would not mind this fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poetry of the idea of Freedom and of the sectional struggle which was
      necessary before that idea could be realized in national policy is on the
      whole not commensurate with the significance of <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span> the issue itself. Any
      collection of American political verse produced during this period
      exhibits spirited and sincere writing, but the combination of mature
      literary art and impressive general ideas is comparatively rare. There are
      single poems of Whittier, Lowell, and Whitman which meet every test of
      effective political and social verse, but the main body of poetry, both
      sectional and national, written during the thirty years ending with 1865
      lacks breadth, power, imaginative daring. The continental spaciousness and
      energy which foreign critics thought they discovered in Whitman is not
      characteristic of our poetry as a whole. Victor Hugo and Shelley and
      Swinburne have written far more magnificent republican poetry than ours.
      The passion for freedom has been very real upon this side of the Atlantic;
      it pulsed in the local loyalty of the men who sang <i>Dixie</i> as well as
      in their antagonists who chanted <i>John Brown's Body</i> and <i>The
      Battle Hymn of the Republic</i>; but this passion has not yet lifted and
      ennobled any notable mass of American verse. Even the sentiment of union
      was more adequately voiced in editorials and sermons and orations, even in
      a short story&mdash;Edward Everett Hale's <i>Man Without a Country</i>&mdash;than
      by most of the poets who attempted to glorify that theme.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
      Nevertheless the verse of these thirty years is rich in provincial and
      sectional loyalties. It has earnestness and pathos. We have, indeed, no
      adequate national anthem, even yet, for neither the words nor the music of
      <i>The Star-Spangled Banner</i> fully express what we feel while we are
      trying to sing it, as the <i>Marseillaise</i>, for example, does express
      the very spirit of revolutionary republicanism. But in true pioneer
      fashion we get along with a makeshift until something better turns up. The
      lyric and narrative verse of the Civil War itself was great in quantity,
      and not more inferior in quality than the war verse of other nations has
      often proved to be when read after the immediate occasion for it has
      passed. Single lyrics by Timrod and Paul Hayne, Boker, H.&nbsp;H.
      Brownell, Read, Stedman, and other men are still full of fire. Yet Mrs.
      Howe's <i>Battle Hymn</i>, scribbled hastily in the gray dawn,
      interpreted, as no other lyric of the war quite succeeded in interpreting,
      the mystical glory of sacrifice for Freedom. Soldiers sang it in camp;
      women read it with tears; children repeated it in school, vaguely but
      truly perceiving in it, as their fathers had perceived in Webster's <i>Reply
      to Hayne</i> thirty years before, the idea of union made "simple,
      sensuous, passionate." No American <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226"
      id="Page_226">226</a></span> poem has had a more dramatic and intense life
      in the quick breathing imagination of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      More and more, however, the instinct of our people is turning to the words
      of Abraham Lincoln as the truest embodiment in language, as his life was
      the truest embodiment in action, of our national ideal. It is a curious
      reversal of contemporary judgments that thus discovers in the homely
      phrases of a frontier lawyer the most perfect literary expression of the
      deeper spirit of his time. "How knoweth this man letters, having never
      learned?" asked the critical East. The answer is that he had learned in a
      better school than the East afforded. The story of Lincoln's life is
      happily too familiar to need retelling here, but some of the elements in
      his growth in the mastery of speech may at least be summarized.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln had a slow, tireless mind, capable of intense concentration. It
      was characteristic of him that he rarely took notes when trying a law
      case, saying that the notes distracted his attention. When his partner
      Herndon was asked when Lincoln had found time to study out the
      constitutional history of the United States, Herndon expressed the opinion
      that it was when Lincoln was lying on his back on the office sofa,
      apparently <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
      watching the flies upon the ceiling. This combination of bodily repose
      with intense mental and spiritual activity is familiar to those who have
      studied the biography of some of the great mystics. Walter Pater pointed
      it out in the case of Wordsworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      In recalling the poverty and restriction of Lincoln's boyhood and his
      infrequent contact with schoolhouses, it is well to remember that he
      managed nevertheless to read every book within twenty miles of him. These
      were not many, it is true, but they included <i>The Bible</i>, <i>&AElig;esop's
      Fables</i>, <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, and, a
      little later, Burns and Shakespeare. Better food than this for the mind of
      a boy has never been found. Then he came to the history of his own country
      since the Declaration of Independence and mastered it. "I am tolerably
      well acquainted with the history of the country," he remarked in his
      Chicago speech of 1858; and in the Cooper Union speech of 1860 he
      exhibited a familiarity with the theory and history of the Constitution
      which amazed the young lawyers who prepared an annotated edition of the
      address. "He has wit, facts, dates," said Douglas, in extenuation of his
      own disinclination to enter upon the famous joint debates, and, when
      Douglas <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
      returned to Washington after the debates were over, he confessed to the
      young Henry Watterson that "he is the greatest debater I have ever met,
      either here or anywhere else." Douglas had won the senatorship and could
      afford to be generous, but he knew well enough that his opponent's facts
      and dates had been unanswerable. Lincoln's mental grip, indeed, was the
      grip of a born wrestler. "I've got him," he had exclaimed toward the end
      of the first debate, and the Protean Little Giant, as Douglas was called,
      had turned and twisted in vain, caught by "that long-armed creature from
      Illinois." He could indeed win the election of 1858, but he had been
      forced into an interpretation of the Dred Scott decision which cost him
      the Presidency in 1860.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln's keen interest in words and definitions, his patience in
      searching the dictionary, is known to every student of his life. Part of
      his singular discrimination in the use of language is due to his legal
      training, but his style was never professionalized. Neither did it have
      anything of that frontier glibness and banality which was the curse of
      popular oratory in the West and South. Words were weapons in the hands of
      this self-taught fighter for ideas: he kept their edges sharp, and <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span> could if
      necessary use them with deadly accuracy. He framed the "Freeport dilemma"
      for the unwary feet of Douglas as cunningly as a fox-hunter lays his trap.
      "Gentlemen," he had said of an earlier effort, "Judge Douglas informed you
      that this speech of mine was probably carefully prepared. <em>I admit that
      it was.</em>"
    </p>
    <p>
      The story, too, was a weapon of attack and defense for this master
      fabulist. Sometimes it was a readier mode of argument than any syllogism;
      sometimes it gave him, like the traditional diplomatist's pinch of snuff,
      an excuse for pausing while he studied his adversary or made up his own
      mind; sometimes, with the instinct of a poetic soul, he invented a parable
      and gravely gave it a historic setting "over in Sangamon County." For
      although upon his intellectual side the man was a subtle and severe
      logician, on his emotional side he was a lover of the concrete and human.
      He was always, like John Bunyan, dreaming and seeing "a man" who
      symbolized something apposite to the occasion. Thus even his invented
      stories aided his marvelous capacity for statement, for specific
      illustration of a general law. Lincoln's destiny was to be that of an
      explainer, at first to a local audience in store or tavern or courtroom,
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span> then
      to upturned serious faces of Illinois farmers who wished to hear national
      issues made clear to them, then to a listening nation in the agony of
      civil war, and ultimately to a world which looks to Lincoln as an exponent
      and interpreter of the essence of democracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the audience increased, the style took on beauty and breadth, as if the
      man's soul were looking through wider and wider windows at the world. But
      it always remained the simplest of styles. In an offhand reply to a
      serenade by an Indiana regiment, or in answering a visiting deputation of
      clergymen at the White House, Lincoln could summarize and clarify a
      complicated national situation with an ease and orderliness and
      fascination that are the despair of professional historians. He never
      wasted a word. "Go to work is the only cure for your case," he wrote to
      John D. Johnston. There are ten words in that sentence and none of over
      four letters. The <i>Gettysburg Address</i> contains but two hundred and
      seventy words, in ten sentences. "It is a flat failure," said Lincoln
      despondently; but Edward Everett, who had delivered "the" oration of that
      day, wrote to the President: "I should be glad if I could flatter myself
      that I came as near to the central idea of <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span> the occasion in two hours as
      you did in two minutes." Today the <i>Address</i> reads as if Lincoln knew
      that it would ultimately be stamped in bronze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the real test of Lincoln's supremacy in our distinctly civic
      literature lies not so much in his skill in the manipulation of language,
      consummate as that was, but rather in those large elements of his nature
      which enabled him to perceive the true quality and ideal of American
      citizenship and its significance to the world. There was melancholy in
      that nature, else there had been a less rich humor; there was mysticism
      and a sense of religion which steadily deepened as his responsibilities
      increased. There was friendliness, magnanimity, pity for the sorrowful,
      patience for the slow of brain and heart, and an expectation for the
      future of humanity which may best be described in the old phrase "waiting
      for the Kingdom of God." His recurrent dream of the ship coming into port
      under full sail, which preluded many important events in his own life&mdash;he
      had it the night before he was assassinated&mdash;is significant not only
      of that triumph of a free nation which he helped to make possible, but
      also of the victory of what he loved to call "the whole family of man."
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
      "That is the real issue," he had declared in closing the debates with
      Douglas; "that is the issue that will continue in this country when these
      poor tongues of Judge Douglas and myself shall be silent. It is the
      eternal struggle between these two principles&mdash;right and wrong&mdash;throughout
      the world. They are the two principles that have stood face to face from
      the beginning of time; and will ever continue to struggle. The one is the
      common right of humanity, and the other the divine right of kings."
    </p>
    <p>
      For this representative Anglo-Saxon man, developed under purely American
      conditions, maturing slowly, keeping close to facts, dying, like the old
      English saint, while he was "still learning," had none of the typical
      hardness and selfishness of the Anglo-Saxon. A brooder and idealist, he
      was one of those "prophetic souls of the wide world dreaming on things to
      come," with sympathies and imagination that reached out beyond the
      immediate urgencies of his race and nation to comprehend the universal
      task and discipline of the sons of men. In true fraternity and democracy
      this Westerner was not only far in advance of his own day, but he is also
      far in advance of ours which raises statues to his memory. Yet he was used
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span> to
      loneliness and to the long view, and even across the welter of the World
      War of the twentieth century Lincoln would be tall enough to see that ship
      coming into the harbor under full sail.

      A New Nation
    </p>
    <p class="noindent">
      <span class="smcap">The</span> changes that have come over the inner
      spirit and the outward expression of American life since Lincoln's day are
      enough to startle the curiosity of the dullest observer. Yet they have
      been accomplished within the lifetime of a single man of letters. The
      author of one of the many campaign biographies of Lincoln in 1860 was
      William Dean Howells, then an Ohio journalist of twenty-three. In 1917, at
      the age of eighty, Mr. Howells is still adding to his long row of charming
      and memorable books. Every phase of American writing since the middle of
      the last century has fallen under the keen and kindly scrutiny of this
      loyal follower of the art of literature. As producer, editor, critic, and
      friend of the foremost writers of his epoch, Mr. Howells has known the
      books of our new national era as no one else could have known them. Some
      future historian of the period may <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235"
      id="Page_235">235</a></span> piece together, from no other sources than
      Mr. Howells's writings, an unrivaled picture of our book-making during
      more than sixty years. All that the present historian can attempt is to
      sketch with bungling fingers a few men and a few tendencies which seem to
      characterize the age.
    </p>
    <p>
      One result of the Civil War was picturesquely set forth in Emerson's <i>Journal</i>.
      The War had unrolled a map of the Union, he said, and hung it in every
      man's house. There was a universal shifting of attention, if not always
      from the province or section to the image of the nation itself, at least a
      shift of focus from one section to another. The clash of arms had meant
      many other things besides the triumph of Union and the freedom of the
      slaves. It had brought men from every state into rude jostling contact
      with one another and had developed a new social and human curiosity. It
      may serve as another illustration of Professor Shaler's law of tension and
      release. The one overshadowing issue which had absorbed so much thought
      and imagination and energy had suddenly disappeared. Other shadows were to
      gather, of course. Reconstruction of the South was one of them, and the
      vast economic and industrial changes that followed the opening of the New
      West were to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
      bring fresh problems almost as intricate as the question of slavery had
      been. But for the moment no one thought of these things. The South
      accepted defeat as superbly as she had fought, and began to plough once
      more. The jubilant North went back to work&mdash;to build transcontinental
      railroads, to organize great industries, and to create new states.
    </p>
    <p>
      The significant American literature of the first decade after the close of
      the War is not in the books dealing directly with themes involved in the
      War itself. It is rather the literature of this new release of energy, the
      new curiosity as to hitherto unknown sections, the new humor and romance.
      Fred Lewis Pattee, the author of an admirable <i>History of American
      Literature since 1870</i>, uses scarcely too strong a phrase when he
      entitles this period "The Second Discovery of America"; and he quotes
      effectively from Mark Twain, who was himself one of these discoverers:
      "The eight years in America from 1860 to 1868 uprooted institutions that
      were centuries old, changed the politics of a people, transformed the
      social life of half the country, and wrought so profoundly upon the entire
      national character that the influence cannot be measured short of two or
      three generations."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span> Let
      us begin with the West, and with that joyous stage-coach journey of young
      Samuel L. Clemens across the plains to Nevada in 1861, which he describes
      in <i>Roughing It</i>. Who was this Argonaut of the new era, and what
      makes him representative of his countrymen in the epoch of release? Born
      in Missouri in 1835, the son of an impractical emigrant from Virginia, the
      youth had lived from his fourth until his eighteenth year on the banks of
      the Mississippi. He had learned the printer's trade, had wandered east and
      back again, had served for four years as a river-pilot on the Mississippi,
      and had tried to enter the Confederate army. Then came the six crowded
      years, chiefly as newspaper reporter, in the boom times of Nevada and
      California. His fame began with the publication in New York in 1867 of <i>The
      Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County</i>. A newspaper now sent him
      to Europe to record "what he sees with his own eyes." He did so in <i>Innocents
      Abroad</i>, and his countrymen shouted with laughter. This, then, was
      "Europe" after all&mdash;another "fake" until this shrewd river-pilot who
      signed himself "Mark Twain" took its soundings! Then came a series of far
      greater books&mdash;<i>Roughing It</i>, <i>Life on the Mississippi</i>, <i>The
      Gilded Age</i> (in collaboration), <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238"
      id="Page_238">238</a></span> and <i>Tom Sawyer</i> and <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>&mdash;books
      that make our American <i>Odyssey</i>, rich in the spirit of romance and
      revealing the magic of the great river as no other pages can ever do
      again. Gradually Mark Twain became a public character; he retrieved on the
      lecture platform the loss of a fortune earned by his books; he enjoyed his
      honorary D. Litt. from Oxford University. Every reader of American
      periodicals came to recognize the photographs of that thick shock of hair,
      those heavy eyebrows, the gallant drooping little figure, the striking
      clothes, the inevitable cigar: all these things seemed to go with the part
      of professional humorist, to be like the caressing drawl of Mark's voice.
      The force of advertisement could no further go. But at bottom he was far
      other than a mere maker of boisterous jokes for people with frontier
      preferences in humor. He was a passionate, chivalric lover of things fair
      and good, although too honest to pretend to see beauty and goodness where
      he could not personally detect them&mdash;and an equally passionate hater
      of evil. Read <i>The Man Who Corrupted Hadleyburg</i> and <i>The
      Mysterious Stranger</i>. In his last years, torn by private sorrows, he
      turned as black a philosophical pessimist as we have bred. He died at
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span> his
      new country seat in Connecticut in 1910. Mr. Paine has written his life in
      three great volumes, and there is a twenty-five volume edition of his <i>Works</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the evidence seems to be in. Yet the verdict of the public seems not
      quite made up. It is clear that Mark Twain the writer of romance is
      gaining upon Mark Twain the humorist. The inexhaustible American appetite
      for frontier types of humor seizes upon each new variety, crunches it with
      huge satisfaction, and then tosses it away. John Phoenix, Josh Billings,
      Jack Downing, Bill Arp, Petroleum V. Nasby, Artemus Ward, Bill Nye&mdash;these
      are already obsolescent names. If Clemens lacked something of Artemus
      Ward's whimsical delicacy and of Josh Billings's tested human wisdom, he
      surpassed all of his competitors in a certain rude, healthy masculinity,
      the humor of river and mining-camp and printing-office, where men speak
      without censorship. His country-men liked exaggeration, and he
      exaggerated; they liked irreverence, and he had turned iconoclast in <i>Innocents
      Abroad</i>. As a professional humorist, he has paid the obligatory tax for
      his extravagance, over-emphasis, and undisciplined taste, but such faults
      are swiftly forgotten when one turns <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span> to Huckleberry Finn and the
      negro Jim and Pudd'nhead Wilson, when one feels Mark Twain's power in
      sheer description and episode, his magic in evoking landscape and
      atmosphere, his blazing scorn at injustice and cruelty, his contempt for
      quacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bret Harte, another discoverer of the West, wears less well than Mark
      Twain as a personal figure, but has a sure place in the evolution of the
      American short story, and he did for the mining-camps of California what
      Clemens wrought for the Mississippi River: he became their profane poet.
      Yet he was never really of them. He was the clever outsider, with a
      prospector's eye, looking for literary material, and finding a whole rich
      mine of it&mdash;a bigger and richer, in fact, than he was really
      qualified to work. But he located a golden vein of it with an instinct
      that did credit to his dash of Hebrew blood. Born in Albany, a teacher's
      son, brought up on books and in many cities, Harte emigrated to California
      in 1854 at the age of sixteen. He became in turn a drug-clerk, teacher,
      type-setter, editor, and even Secretary of the California Mint&mdash;his
      nearest approach, apparently, to the actual work of the mines. In 1868,
      while editor of <i>The Overland Monthly</i>, he wrote the short <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span> story
      which was destined to make him famous in the East and to release him from
      California forever. It was <i>The Luck of Roaring Camp</i>. He had been
      writing romantic sketches in prose and verse for years; he had steeped
      himself in Dickens, like everybody else in the eighteen-sixties; and now
      he saw his pay-gravel shining back into his own shining eyes. It was a
      pocket, perhaps, rather than a lead, but Bret Harte worked to the end of
      his career this material furnished by the camps, this method of the short
      story. He never returned to California after his joyous exit in 1871. For
      a few years he tried living in New York, but from 1878 until his death in
      1902 Bret Harte lived in Europe, still turning out California stories for
      an English and American public which insisted upon that particular
      pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the pattern was arbitrary, theatrical, sentimental, somewhat
      meretricious in design, in a word insincere like its inventor, has been
      repeated at due intervals ever since 1868. The charge is true; yet it is
      far from the whole truth concerning Bret Harte's artistry. In mastery of
      the technique of the short story he is fairly comparable with Poe, though
      less original, for it was Poe who formulated, when Bret Harte was a child
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span> of
      six, the well-known theory of the unity of effect of the brief tale. This
      unity Harte secured through a simplification, often an insulation, of his
      theme, the omission of quarreling details, an atmosphere none the less
      novel for its occasional theatricality, and characters cunningly modulated
      to the one note they were intended to strike. <i>Tennessee's Partner</i>,
      <i>The Outcast of Poker Flat</i>, and all the rest are triumphs of
      selective skill&mdash;as bright nuggets as ever glistened in the pan at
      the end of a hard day's labor. That they do not adequately represent the
      actual California of the fifties, as old Californians obstinately insist,
      is doubtless true, but it is beside the point. Here is no Tolstoi painting
      the soul of his race in a few pages: Harte is simply a disciple of Poe and
      Dickens, turning the Poe construction trick gracefully, with Dickensy
      characters and consistently romantic action.
    </p>
    <p>
      The West has been rediscovered many a time since that decade which
      witnessed the first literary bonanza of Mark Twain and Bret Harte. It will
      continue to be discovered, in its fresh sources of appeal to the
      imagination, as long as Plains and Rockies and Coast endure, as long as
      there is any glow upon a distant horizon. It is <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span> not places that lose romantic
      interest: the immemorial English counties and the Bay of Naples offer
      themselves freely to the artist, generation after generation. What is lost
      is the glamour of youth, the specific atmosphere of a given historical
      epoch. Colonel W.&nbsp;F. Cody ("Buffalo Bill") has typified to millions
      of American boys the great period of the Plains, with its Indian fighting,
      its slaughter of buffaloes, its robbing of stage-coaches, its superb
      riders etched against the sky. But the Wild West was retreating, even in
      the days of Daniel Boone and Davy Crockett. The West of the cowboys, as
      Theodore Roosevelt and Owen Wister knew it and wrote of it in the eighties
      and nineties, has disappeared, though it lives on in fiction and on the
      screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack London, born in California in 1876, was forced to find his West in
      Alaska&mdash;and in alcohol. He was what he and his followers liked to
      call the virile or red-blooded type, responsive to the "Call of the Wild,"
      "living life naked and tensely." In his talk Jack London was simple and
      boyish, with plenty of humor over his own literary and social foibles. His
      books are very uneven, but he wrote many a hard-muscled, clean-cut page.
      If the Bret Harte theory of the West was that each man is at <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span> bottom a
      sentimentalist, Jack London's formula was that at bottom every man is a
      brute. Each theory gave provender enough for a short-story writer to carry
      on his back, but is hardly adequate, by itself, for a very long voyage
      over human life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Joaquin" (Cincinnatus Heine) Miller, who was born in 1841 and died in
      1913, had even less of a formula for the West than Jack London. He was a
      word-painter of its landscapes, a rider over its surfaces. Cradled "in a
      covered wagon pointing West," mingling with wild frontier life from Alaska
      to Nicaragua, miner, Indian fighter, hermit, poseur in London and
      Washington, then hermit again in California, the author of <i>Songs of the
      Sierras</i> at least knew his material. Byron, whom he adored and
      imitated, could have invented nothing more romantic than Joaquin's life;
      but though Joaquin inherited Scotch intensity, he had nothing of the close
      mental grip of the true Scot and nothing of his humor. Vast stretches of
      his poetry are empty; some of it is grandiose, elemental, and yet somehow
      artificial, as even the Grand Canyon itself looks at certain times.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Muir, another immigrant Scot who reached California in 1868, had far
      more stuff in him than Joaquin Miller. He had studied geology, botany,
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span> and
      chemistry at the new University of Wisconsin, and then for years turned
      explorer of forests, peaks, and glaciers, not writing, at first, except in
      his <i>Journal</i>, but forever absorbing and worshiping sublimity and
      beauty with no thought of literary schemes. Yet his every-day talk about
      his favorite trees and glaciers had more of the glow of poetry in it than
      any talk I have ever heard from men of letters, and his books and <i>Journal</i>
      will long perpetuate this thrilling sense of personal contact with wild,
      clean, uplifted things&mdash;blossoms in giant tree-tops and snow-eddies
      blowing round the shoulders of Alaskan peaks. Here is a West as far above
      Jack London's and Frank Norris's as the snow-line is higher than the
      jungle.

      The rediscovery of the South was not so much an exploration of fresh or
      forgotten geographical territory, as it was a new perception of the
      romantic human material offered by a peculiar civilization. Political and
      social causes had long kept the South in isolation. A few writers like
      Wirt, Kennedy, Longstreet, Simms, had described various aspects of its
      life with grace or vivacity, but the best picture of colonial Virginia had
      been drawn, after all, by Thackeray, who had merely read about it in
      books. Visitors like Fanny Kemble and <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span> Frederick Law Olmsted
      sketched the South of the mid-nineteenth century more vividly than did the
      sons of the soil. There was no real literary public in the South for a
      native writer like Simms. He was as dependent upon New York and the
      Northern market as a Virginian tobacco-planter of 1740 had been upon
      London. But within a dozen years after the close of the War and
      culminating in the eighteen-nineties, there came a rich and varied harvest
      of Southern writing, notably in the field of fiction. The public for these
      stories, it is true, was still largely in the North and West, and it was
      the magazines and publishing-houses of New York and Boston that gave the
      Southern authors their chief stimulus and support. It was one of the happy
      proofs of the solidarity of the new nation.

      The romance of the Spanish and French civilization of New Orleans, as
      revealed in Mr. Cable's fascinating <i>Old Creole Days</i>, was
      recognized, not as something merely provincial in its significance, but as
      contributing to the infinitely variegated pattern of our national life.
      Irwin Russell, Joel Chandler Harris, and Thomas Nelson Page portrayed in
      verse and prose the humorous, pathetic, unique traits of the Southern
      negro, a type hitherto <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247"
      id="Page_247">247</a></span> chiefly sketched in caricature or by
      strangers. Page, Hopkinson Smith, Grace King, and a score of other artists
      began to draw affectionate pictures of the vanished Southern mansion of
      plantation days, when all the women were beautiful and all the men were
      brave, when the very horses were more spirited and the dogs lazier and the
      honeysuckles sweeter and the moonlight more entrancing than today. Miss
      Murfree ("C.&nbsp;E. Craddock") charmed city-dwellers and country-folk
      alike by her novels of the Tennessee mountains. James Lane Allen painted
      lovingly the hemp-fields and pastures of Kentucky. American magazines of
      the decade from 1880 to 1890 show the complete triumph of dialect and
      local color, and this movement, so full of interest to students of the
      immense divergence of American types, owed much of its vitality to the
      talent of Southern writers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the impulse spread far beyond the South. Early in the seventies Edward
      Eggleston wrote <i>The Hoosier Schoolmaster</i> and <i>The Circuit Rider</i>,
      faithful and moving presentations of genuine pioneer types which were
      destined to pass with the frontier settlements. Soon James Whitcomb Riley
      was to sing of the next generation of Hoosiers, who frequented <i>The Old
      Swimmin' Hole</i> and rejoiced <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248"
      id="Page_248">248</a></span> <i>When the Frost is on the Punkin</i>. It
      was the era of Denman Thompson's plays, <i>Joshua Whitcomb</i> and <i>The
      Old Homestead</i>. Both the homely and the exotic marched under this
      banner of local color: Hamlin Garland presented Iowa barnyards and
      cornfields, Helen Hunt Jackson dreamed the romance of the Mission Indian
      in <i>Ramona</i>, and Lafcadio Hearn, Irish and Greek by blood, resident
      of New Orleans and not yet an adopted citizen of Japan, tantalized
      American readers with his <i>Chinese Ghosts</i> and <i>Chita</i>. A
      fascinating period it seems, as one looks back upon it, and it lasted
      until about the end of the century, when the suddenly discovered
      commercial value of the historical novel and the ensuing competition in
      best sellers misled many a fine artistic talent and coarsened the public
      taste. The New South then played the literary market as recklessly as the
      New West.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us glance back to "the abandoned farm of literature," as a witty New
      Yorker once characterized New England. The last quarter of the nineteenth
      century witnessed a decline in the direct influence of that province over
      the country as a whole. Its strength sapped by the emigration of its more
      vigorous sons, its typical institutions sagging under the weight of
      immense immigrations <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
      from Europe, its political importance growing more and more negligible,
      that ancient promontory of ideas has continued to lose its relative
      literary significance. In one field of literature only has New England
      maintained its rank since the Civil War, and that is in the local short
      story. Here women have distinguished themselves beyond the proved capacity
      of New England men. Mrs. Stowe and Rose Terry Cooke, women of democratic
      humor, were the pioneers; then came Harriet Prescott Spofford and
      Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, women with nerves; and finally the three artists
      who have written, out of the material offered by a decadent New England,
      as perfect short stories as France or Russia can produce&mdash;Sarah Orne
      Jewett, Mary Wilkins Freeman, and Alice Brown. These gifted writers
      portrayed, with varying technique and with singular differences in their
      instinctive choice of material, the dominant qualities of an isolated,
      in-bred race, still proud in its decline; still inquisitive and
      acquisitive, versatile yet stubborn, with thrift passing over into
      avarice, and mental power degenerating into smartness; cold and hard under
      long repression of emotion, yet capable of passion and fanaticism; at
      worst, a mere trader, a crank, a grim recluse; at best, endowed <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span> with an
      austere physical and moral beauty. Miss Jewett preferred to touch
      graciously the sunnier slopes of this provincial temperament, to linger in
      its ancient dignities and serenities. Miss Brown has shown the pathos of
      its thwarted desires, its hunger for a beauty and a happiness denied. Mary
      Wilkins Freeman revealed its fundamental tragedies of will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of the best known writers of New England fiction in this period were
      not natives of the soil, though they surpassed most native New Englanders
      in their understanding of the type. They were William Dean Howells and
      Henry James. Mr. Howells, who, in his own words, "can reasonably suppose
      that it is because of the mixture of Welsh, German, and Irish in me that I
      feel myself so typically American," came to "the Holy Land at Boston" as a
      "passionate pilgrim from the West." <i>A Boy's Town</i>, <i>My Literary
      Passions</i>, and <i>Years of my Youth</i> make clear the image of the
      young poet-journalist who returned from his four years in Venice and
      became assistant editor of <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i> in 1866. In 1871 he
      succeeded Fields in the editorship, but it was not until after his
      resignation in 1881 that he could put his full strength into those <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span> realistic
      novels of contemporary New England which established his fame as a writer.
      <i>A Modern Instance</i> and <i>The Rise of Silas Lapham</i> are perhaps
      the finest stories of this group; and the latter novel may prove to be Mr.
      Howells's chief "visiting-card to posterity." We cannot here follow him to
      New York and to a new phase of novel writing, begun with <i>A Hazard of
      New Fortunes</i>, nor can we discuss the now antiquated debate upon
      realism which was waged in the eighteen-eighties over the books of Howells
      and James. We must content ourselves with saying that a knowledge of Mr.
      Howells's work is essential to the student of the American provincial
      novel, as it is also to the student of our more generalized types of
      story-writing, and that he has never in his long career written an
      insincere, a slovenly, or an infelicitous page. <i>My Literary Friends and
      Acquaintance</i> gives the most charming picture ever drawn of the elder
      Cambridge, Concord, and Boston men who ruled over our literature when
      young Howells came out of the West, and <i>My Mark Twain</i> is his
      memorable portrait of another type of sovereign, perhaps the dynasty that
      will rule the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Henry James, like Mr. Howells, wrote at one time acute studies of
      New England character, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252"
      id="Page_252">252</a></span> he was never, in his relations to that
      section, or, for that matter, to any locality save possibly London,
      anything more than a "visiting mind." His grandfather was an Irish
      merchant in Albany. His father, Henry James, was a philosopher and wit, a
      man of comfortable fortune, who lived at times in Newport, Concord, and
      Boston, but who was residing in New York when his son Henry was born in
      1843. No child was ever made the subject of a more complete theory of
      deracination. Transplanted from city to city, from country to country,
      without a family or a voting-place, without college or church or creed or
      profession or responsibility of any kind save to his own exigent ideals of
      truth and beauty, Henry James came to be the very pattern of a
      cosmopolitan. Avoiding his native country for nearly thirty years and then
      returning for a few months to write some intricate pages about that <i>American
      Scene</i> which he understood far less truly than the average immigrant,
      he died in 1916 in London, having just renounced his American citizenship
      and become a British subject in order to show his sympathy with the
      Empire, then at war. It was the sole evidence of political emotion in a
      lifetime of seventy-three years.

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
      American writing men are justly proud, nevertheless, of this expatriated
      craftsman. The American is inclined to admire good workmanship of any
      kind, as far as he can understand the mechanism of it. The task of really
      understanding Henry James has been left chiefly to clever women and to a
      few critics, but ever since <i>A Passionate Pilgrim</i> and <i>Roderick
      Hudson</i> appeared in 1875, it has been recognized that here was a
      master, in his own fashion. What that fashion is may now be known by
      anyone who will take the pains to read the author's prefaces to the New
      York edition of his revised works. Never, not even in the Paris which
      James loved, has an artist put his intentions and his self-criticism more
      definitively upon paper. The secret of Henry James is told plainly enough
      here: a specially equipped intelligence, a freedom from normal
      responsibilities, a consuming desire to create beautiful things, and, as
      life unfolded its complexities and <i>nuances</i> before his vision, an
      increasing passion to seek the beauty which lies entangled and betrayed, a
      beauty often adumbrated rather than made plastic, stories that must be
      hinted at rather than told, raptures that exist for the initiated only.
      The much discussed early and middle and later manners <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span> of James are only various
      campaigns of this one questing spirit, changing his procedure as the
      elusive object of his search hid itself by this or that device of
      protective coloration or swift escape. It is as if a collector of rare
      butterflies had one method of capturing them in Madagascar, another for
      the Orinoco, and still another for Japan&mdash;though Henry James found
      his Japan and Orinoco and Madagascar all in London town!
    </p>
    <p>
      No one who ever had the pleasure of hearing him discourse about the art of
      fiction can forget the absolute seriousness of his professional devotion;
      it was as though a shy celebrant were to turn and explain, with mystical
      intensity and a mystic's involution and reversal of all the values of
      vulgar speech, the ceremonial of some strange, high altar. His own power
      as a creative artist was not always commensurate with his intellectual
      endowment or with his desire after beauty, and his frank contempt for the
      masses of men made it difficult for him to write English. He preferred, as
      did Browning, who would have liked to reach the masses, a dialect of his
      own, and he used it increasingly after he was fifty. It was a dialect
      capable of infinite gradations of tone, endless refinements of expression.
      In his threescore books there are <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255"
      id="Page_255">255</a></span> delicious poignant moments where the spirit
      of life itself flutters like a wild creature, half-caught, half-escaping.
      It is for the beauty and thrill of these moments that the pages of Henry
      James will continue to be cherished by a few thousand readers scattered
      throughout the Republic to which he was ever an alien.
    </p>
    <p>
      No poet of the new era has won the national recognition enjoyed by the
      veterans. It will be recalled that Bryant survived until 1878, Longfellow
      and Emerson until 1882, Lowell until 1891, Whittier and Whitman until
      1892, and Holmes until 1894. Compared with these men the younger writers
      of verse seemed overmatched. The <i>National Ode</i> for the Centennial
      celebration in 1876 was intrusted to Bayard Taylor, a hearty person,
      author of capital books of travel, plentiful verse, and a skilful
      translation of <i>Faust</i>. But an adequate <i>National Ode</i> was not
      in him. Sidney Lanier, who was writing in that year his <i>Psalm of the
      West</i> and was soon to compose <i>The Marshes of Glynn</i>, had far more
      of the divine fire. He was a bookish Georgia youth who had served with the
      Confederate army, and afterward, with broken health and in dire poverty,
      gave his brief life to music and poetry. He had rich capacities for <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span> both arts,
      but suffered in both from the lack of discipline and from an impetuous,
      restless imagination which drove him on to over-ambitious designs.
      Whatever the flaws in his affluent verse, it has grown constantly in
      popular favor, and he is, after Poe, the best known poet of the South. The
      late Edmund Clarence Stedman, whose <i>American Anthology</i> and critical
      articles upon American poets did so much to enhance the reputation of
      other men, was himself a maker of ringing lyrics and spirited narrative
      verse. His later days were given increasingly to criticism, and his <i>Life
      and Letters</i> is a storehouse of material bearing upon the growth of New
      York as a literary market-place during half a century. Richard Watson
      Gilder was another admirably fine figure, poet, editor, and leader of
      public opinion in many a noble cause. His <i>Letters</i>, likewise, give
      an intimate picture of literary New York from the seventies to the
      present. Through his editorship of <i>Scribner's Monthly</i> and <i>The
      Century Magazine</i> his sound influence made itself felt upon writers in
      every section. His own lyric vein had an opaline intensity of fire, but in
      spite of its glow his verse sometimes refused to sing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most perfect poetic craftsman of the <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span> period&mdash;and, many think,
      our one faultless worker in verse&mdash;was Thomas Bailey Aldrich. His
      first volume of juvenile verse had appeared in 1855, the year of
      Whittier's <i>Barefoot Boy</i> and Whitman's <i>Leaves of Grass</i>. By
      1865 his poems were printed in the then well-known Blue and Gold edition,
      by Ticknor and Fields. In 1881 he succeeded Howells in the editorship of
      the <i>Atlantic</i>. Aldrich had a versatile talent that turned easily to
      adroit prose tales, but his heart was in the filing of his verses. Nothing
      so daintily perfect as his lighter pieces has been produced on this side
      of the Atlantic, and the deeper notes and occasional darker questionings
      of his later verse are embodied in lines of impeccable workmanship. Aloof
      from the social and political conflicts of his day, he gave himself to the
      fastidious creation of beautiful lines, believing that the beautiful line
      is the surest road to Arcady, and that Herrick, whom he idolized, had
      shown the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      To some readers of these pages it may seem like profanation to pass over
      poets like Sill, George Woodberry, Edith Thomas, Richard Hovey, William
      Vaughn Moody, Madison Cawein&mdash;to mention but half a dozen
      distinguished names out of a larger company&mdash;and to suggest that
      James Whitcomb <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
      Riley, more completely than any American poet since Longfellow, succeeded
      in expressing the actual poetic feelings of the men and women who composed
      his immense audience. Riley, like Aldrich, went to school to Herrick,
      Keats, Tennyson, and Longfellow, but when he began writing newspaper verse
      in his native Indiana he was guided by two impulses which gave
      individuality to his work. "I was always trying to write of the kind of
      people I knew, and especially to write verse that I could read just as if
      it were spoken for the first time." The first impulse kept him close to
      the wholesome Hoosier soil. The second is an anticipation of Robert
      Frost's theory of speech tones as the basis of verse, as well as a revival
      of the bardic practice of reciting one's own poems. For Riley had much of
      the actor and platform-artist in him, and comprehended that poetry might
      be made again a spoken art, directed to the ear rather than to the eye.
      His vogue, which at his death in 1915 far surpassed that of any living
      American poet, is inexplicable to those persons only who forget the
      sentimental traditions of our American literature and its frank appeal to
      the emotions of juvenility, actual and recollected. Riley's best "holt" as
      a poet was his memory of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259"
      id="Page_259">259</a></span> his own boyhood and his perception that the
      child-mind lingers in every adult reader. Genius has often been called the
      gift of prolonged adolescence, and in this sense, surely, there was genius
      in the warm and gentle heart of this fortunate provincial who held that
      "old Indianapolis" was "high Heaven's sole and only under-study." No one
      has ever had the audacity to say that of New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have had American drama for one hundred and fifty years, &sup1; but
      much of it, like our popular fiction and poetry, has been subliterary,
      more interesting to the student of social life and national character than
      to literary criticism in the narrow sense of that term. Few of our best
      known literary men have written for the stage. The public has preferred
      melodrama to poetic tragedy, although perhaps the greatest successes have
      been scored by plays which are comedies of manners rather than melodrama,
      and character studies of various American types, built up around the known
      capabilities of a particular actor. The twentieth century has witnessed a
      marked activity in play-writing, in the technical study of the drama,
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span> and
      in experiment with dramatic production, particularly with motion pictures
      and the out-of-doors pageant. At no time since <i>The Prince of Parthia</i>
      was first acted in Philadelphia in 1767 has such a large percentage of
      Americans been artistically and commercially interested in the drama, but
      as to the literary results of the new movement it is too soon to speak.

    <p>
      Nor is it possible to forecast the effect of a still more striking
      movement of contemporary taste, the revival of interest in poetry and the
      experimentation with new poetical forms. Such revival and experiment have
      often, in the past, been the preludes of great epochs of poetical
      production. Living Americans have certainly never seen such a widespread
      demand for contemporary verse, such technical curiosity as to the possible
      forms of poetry, or such variety of bold innovation. Imagism itself is
      hardly as novel as its contemporary advocates appear to maintain, and free
      verse goes back far in our English speech and song. But the new generation
      believes that it has made a discovery in reverting to sensations rather
      than thought, to the na&iuml;ve reproduction of retinal and muscular
      impressions, as if this were the end of the matter. <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span> The self-conscious,
      self-defending side of the new poetic impulse may soon pass, as it did in
      the case of Wordsworth and of Victor Hugo. Whatever happens, we have
      already had fresh and exquisite revelations of natural beauty, and, in
      volumes like <i>North of Boston</i> and <i>A Spoon River Anthology</i>,
      judgments of life that run very deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      American fiction seems just now, on the contrary, to be marking time and
      not to be getting noticeably forward. Few names unknown ten years ago have
      won wide recognition in the domain of the novel. The short story has made
      little technical advance since the first successes of "O. Henry," though
      the talent of many observers has dealt with new material offered by the
      racial characteristics of European immigrants and by new phases of
      commerce and industry. The enormous commercial demand of the five-cent
      weeklies for short stories of a few easily recognized patterns has
      resulted too often in a substitution of stencil-plate generalized types
      instead of delicately and powerfully imagined individual characters. Short
      stories have been assembled, like Ford cars, with amazing mechanical
      expertness, but with little artistic advance in design. The same temporary
      arrest of progress has <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262"
      id="Page_262">262</a></span> been noted in France and England, however,
      where different causes have been at work. No one can tell, in truth, what
      makes some plants in the literary garden wither at the same moment that
      others are outgrowing their borders.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one plant in our own garden, however, whose flourishing state
      will be denied by nobody&mdash;namely, that kind of nature-writing
      identified with Thoreau and practised by Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Starr
      King, John Burroughs, John Muir, Clarence King, Bradford Torrey, Theodore
      Roosevelt, William J. Long, Thompson-Seton, Stewart Edward White, and many
      others. Their books represent, Professor Canby &sup1; believes, the
      adventures of the American subconsciousness, the promptings of forgotten
      memories, a racial tradition of contact with the wilderness, and hence one
      of the most genuinely American traits of our literature.

      Other forms of essay writing, surely, have seemed in our own generation
      less distinctive of our peculiar quality. While admirable biographical and
      critical studies appear from time to time, and here and there a whimsical
      or trenchant discursive essay like those of Miss Repplier or Dr. <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span> Crothers,
      no one would claim that we approach France or even England in the field of
      criticism, literary history, memoirs, the bookish essay, and biography. We
      may have race-memories of a pine-tree which help us to write vigorously
      and poetically about it, but we write less vitally as soon as we enter the
      library door. A Frenchman does not, for he is better trained to perceive
      the continuity and integrity of race-consciousness, in the whole field of
      its manifestation. He does not feel, as many Americans do, that they are
      turning their back on life when they turn to books.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the truth is that although we are a reading people we are not yet
      a book-loving people. The American newspaper and magazine have been
      successful in making their readers fancy that newspaper and magazine are
      an equivalent for books. Popular orators and popular preachers confirm
      this impression, and colleges and universities have often emphasized a
      vocational choice of books&mdash;in other words, books that are not books
      at all, but treatises. It is not, of course, that American journalism,
      whether of the daily or monthly sort, has consciously set itself to
      supplant the habit of book-reading. A thousand social and economic factors
      enter into such a problem. But <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264"
      id="Page_264">264</a></span> few observers will question the assertion
      that the influence of the American magazine, ever since its great period
      of national literary service in the eighties and nineties, has been more
      marked in the field of conduct and of artistic taste than in the
      stimulation of a critical literary judgment. An American schoolhouse of
      today owes its improvement in appearance over the schoolhouse of fifty
      years ago largely to the popular diffusion, through the illustrated
      magazines, of better standards of artistic taste. But whether the judgment
      of school-teachers and school-children upon a piece of literature is any
      better than it was in the red schoolhouse of fifty years ago is a
      disputable question.
    </p>

    <p>
      But we must stop guessing, or we shall never have done. The fundamental
      problem of our literature, as this book has attempted to trace it, has
      been to obtain from a mixed population dwelling in sections as widely
      separated as the peoples of Northern and Southern Europe, an integral
      intellectual and spiritual activity which could express, in obedience to
      the laws of beauty and truth, the emotions stimulated by our national
      life. It has been assumed in the preceding chapters that <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span> American
      literature is something different from English literature written in
      America. Canadian and Australian literatures have indigenous qualities of
      their own, but typically they belong to the colonial literature of Great
      Britain. This can scarcely be said of the writings of Franklin and
      Jefferson, and it certainly cannot be said of the writings of Cooper,
      Hawthorne, Emerson, Thoreau, Whitman, Lowell, Lincoln, Mark Twain, and Mr.
      Howells. In the pages of these men and of hundreds of others less
      distinguished, there is a revelation of a new national type. That the full
      energies of this nation have been back of our books, giving them a range
      and vitality and unity commensurate with the national existence, no one
      would claim. There are other spheres of effort in which American character
      has been more adequately expressed than in words. Nevertheless the books
      are here, in spite of every defect in national discipline, every flaw in
      national character; and they deserve the closest attention from all those
      who are trying to understand the American mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the effort toward an expression of a peculiarly complex national
      experience has been the problem of our literary past, the literary problem
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span> of
      the future is the expression of the adjustment of American ideals to the
      standards of civilization. "Patriotism," said the martyred Edith Cavell
      just before her death, "is not enough." Nationality and the instincts of
      national separatism now seem essential to the preservation of the
      political units of the world-state, precisely as a healthy individualism
      must be the basis of all enduring social fellowship. Yet it is clear that
      civilization is a larger, more ultimate term than nationality. Chauvinism
      is nowhere more repellent than in the things of the mind. It is difficult
      for some Americans to think internationally even in political affairs&mdash;to
      construe our national policy and duty in terms of obligation to
      civilization. Nevertheless the task must be faced, and we are slowly
      realizing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the field of literature, likewise, Americanism is not a final word
      either of blame or praise. It is a word of useful characterization. Only
      American books, and not books written in English in America, can
      adequately represent our national contribution to the world's thinking and
      feeling. So argued Emerson and Whitman, long ago. But the younger of these
      two poets came to realize in his old age that <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span> the New World and the Old
      World are fundamentally one. The literature of the New World will
      inevitably have an accent of its own, but it must speak the
      mother-language of civilization, share in its culture, accept its
      discipline.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been said disparagingly of Longfellow and his friends: "The houses
      of the Brahmins had only eastern windows. The souls of the whole school
      lived in the old lands of culture, and they visited these lands as often
      as they could, and, returning, brought back whole libraries of books which
      they eagerly translated." But even if Longfellow and his friends had been
      nothing more than translators and diffusers of European culture, their
      task would have been justified. They kept the ideals of civilization from
      perishing in this new soil. Through those eastern windows came in, and
      still comes in, the sunlight to illumine the American spirit. To decry the
      literatures of the Orient and of Greece and Rome as something now outgrown
      by America, is simply to close the eastern windows, to narrow our
      conception of civilization to merely national and contemporaneous terms.
      It is as provincial to attempt this restriction in literature as it would
      be in world-politics. We must have all the windows open in our American
      writing, free access to ideas, knowledge of universal standards,
      perception of universal law.

        Introduction:
      </h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      The Chronicles of America Series has two similar editions of each volume
      in the series. One version is the Abraham Lincoln edition of the series, a
      premium version which includes full-page pictures. A textbook edition was
      also produced, which does not contain the pictures and captions associated
      with the pictures, but is otherwise the same book. This book was produced
      to match the textbook edition of the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have retained the original punctuation and spelling in the book, but
      there are a few exceptions. Obvious errors were corrected--and all of
      these changes can be found in the <i>Detailed Notes Section</i> of these
      notes. The spelling of some index entries were changed to match the
      spelling used in the text. The <i>Detailed Notes Section</i> also includes
      issues that have come up during transcription. One common issue is that
      words are sometimes split into two lines for spacing purposes in the
      original text. These words are hyphenated in the physical book, but there
      is a question sometimes as to whether the hyphen should be retained in
      transcription. The reasons behind some of these decisions are itemized.

      <h4>
        A Note on Centuries
      </h4>
      <p class="noindent">
        Throughout the <i>Chronicles of America</i> series, most authors have
        chosen to hyphenate "seventeenth-century customs" but not hyphenate
        "customs in the seventeenth century." In the latter case, seventeenth
        century is the object of a preposition, while in the former case,
        seventeenth-century is an adjective. This book somewhat adheres to that
        standard. Below is a list of phrases in this text which ought to have
        the hyphen, but do not, and hence, do not adhere to the standard
        previously outlined. None of these clauses were changed in
        transcription.

        Chapter II
      </h4>
      <p class="noindent">
        &bull; <a href="#Page_36">Page 36</a>:<br /> Under-estimate is hyphenated
        and split between two lines for spacing in the sentence: "It is the
        present fashion to under-estimate the power of Wigglesworth's verse."
        There is one other occurrence of underestimate and there is one
        occurrence of underestimated, both spelled without the hyphen.

        Chapter IV

      <p class="noindent">
        &bull; <a href="#Page_72">Page 72</a>:<br /> State-papers is hyphenated
        and split between two lines for spacing in the clause: "orations and
        pamphlets and state-papers inspired by." On page 67, state papers is
        written as two words and on page 82, state paper is written as two
        words. While state-papers can only be transcribed as "state-papers" or
        "statepapers," "state papers" is the only option consistent with the
        author's other usage of the phrase. The word was transcribed "state
        papers."

        split between two lines for spacing in the clause "watching the birds in
        the treetops of Elmwood." On page 245, tree-tops was spelled with a
        hyphen, so we kept the hyphen here.<br /> &bull; <a href="#Page_98">Page
        98</a>:<br /> Stout-hearted is hyphenated and split between two lines in
        the clause: "the stout-hearted old pioneer could afford to bide his
        time." On page 84, a variation of the word includes the hyphen: "his
        stout-heartedness in disaster." Therefore, we retained the hyphen.

        did not have a hyphen: <i>The Snow Image.</i> <br /> &bull; <a
        href="#Page_153">Page 153</a>:<br /> Fellow-men was hyphenated and split
        between two lines for spacing. There was no other usage of the word in

        &bull; <a href="#Page_172">Page 172</a>:<br /> <i>The First Snow-Fall</i>
        was hyphenated and split between two lines for spacing. There was no

        1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&trade;
        electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
        and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
        (trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all the
        terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy all
        copies of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works in your possession.
        If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
        Gutenberg&trade; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
        terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
        entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

      <p class="boilerplate">
        1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be used
        on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree
        to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few things that
        you can do with most Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works even
        without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See paragraph
        1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project Gutenberg&trade;
        electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help
        preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic
        works. See paragraph 1.E below.

      <p class="boilerplate">
        1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
        or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
        Gutenberg&trade; electronic works. Nearly all the individual works in
        the collection are in the public domain in the United States. If an
        individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
        located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you
        from copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating
        derivative works based on the work as long as all references to Project
        Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope that you will support the
        Project Gutenberg&trade; mission of promoting free access to electronic
        works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&trade; works in compliance
        with the terms of this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg&trade;
        name associated with the work. You can easily comply with the terms of
        this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached
        full Project Gutenberg&trade; License when you share it without charge
        with others.

      <p class="boilerplate">
        1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
        what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are in
        a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States, check
        the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
        before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
        creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project

        Project Gutenberg &trade; is synonymous with the free distribution of
        electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
        including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
        because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
        people in all walks of life.
      </p>
      <p class="boilerplate">
        Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the

        goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&trade; collection will
        remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
        and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&trade; and future
        generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

      <p class="boilerplate">
        Project Gutenberg&trade; depends upon and cannot survive without wide
        spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
        increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
        freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
        array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
        ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
        status with the IRS.
      </p>
      <p class="boilerplate">
        The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
        charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
        States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
        considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
        with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
        we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To <em>send
        donations</em> or determine the status of compliance for any particular
        state visit http://pglaf.org.
      </p>
      <p class="boilerplate">
        While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
        have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
        against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
        approach us with offers to donate.
      </p>
      <p class="boilerplate">
        International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
        statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside
        the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

      <p class="boilerplate">
        Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg&trade;
        concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
        with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
        Gutenberg&trade; eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
      </p>
      <p class="boilerplate">
        Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks are often created from several printed
        editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless
        a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks
        in compliance with any particular paper edition.
